1,"Five Wall Street ‚ÄòCasino‚Äô Banks Hold $223 Trillion in Derivatives ‚Äî 83 Percent of All of the Derivatives held at 4,600 Banks. The vast majority of which are held in SWAPS. Everything is fine üî•","By Pam Martens and Russ Martens: February 13, 2024 ~
According to the Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission (FCIC), derivatives played a major role in the financial crash of 2007 to 2010 in the United States, the worst financial crisis in the U.S. since the Great Depression of the 1930s. The FCIC wrote in its final report: ‚Äú‚Ä¶the existence of millions of derivatives contracts of all types between systemically important financial institutions ‚Äî unseen and unknown in this unregulated market ‚Äî added to uncertainty and escalated panic‚Ä¶.‚Äù
Americans believed that the Dodd-Frank financial reform legislation of 2010 would fulfill its promise of reining in concentrated risks like derivatives. It did not. (See our report from 2015: President Has His Facts Seriously Wrong on Financial Reform.)
According to data from the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), the regulator of national banks, as of March 31, 2009, five bank holding companies held $277.57 trillion in derivatives (notional/face amount). At that time, according to the FDIC, there were 8,249 federally-insured commercial banks and savings associations in the U.S. but just five bank holding companies held 95 percent of all derivatives at all U.S. banks. Those financial institutions were: JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America, Goldman Sachs Group, Morgan Stanley and Citigroup.

Would it be worth it to pay for these courses?

25,Using Eminent Domaine To Seize Housing from Wall Street Companies,"One of the biggest problems in the U.S. are the exorbitant prices of housing and rent. We must lower prices. The following idea sounds draconian but extreme measures are needed. Hear me out: One way to force housing onto the market is for Congress to confiscate all housing, using eminent domaine laws, from Wall Street investment companies.
Though not complete, lets look at one investment firm. Blackstone owns and manages over 300,000 units of rental housing in the U.S., making it the largest landlord in the U.S. To give readers a sense of the magnitude of money involved, recently, Blackstone bought out Tricon Residential, which owned 37,478 homes, for $3.5-billion. Then there's American Homes 4 Rent, which owns 59,092 single-family homes. Invitation Homes owns 84,697 single-family homes. Most single-family rental giants are privately held or consolidated into a broader real estate investment trust (REIT). The list of Wall Street money in housing goes and on and on, and people wonder why housing is so expensive.
According to the Census Bureau, there were approximately 15.1 million vacant homes nationwide in 2022. These vacant homes, which include rentals, represent 10.5% of the country‚Äôs total housing inventory. In addition, according to national data provider CoreLogic, investment companies accounted for 27% of all single-family home purchases. This must be outlawed.

Oleksandr Syrskiy, who is seen as closer to the president, will bind Zelensky more tightly to battlefield decisions, making him more accountable for any failure - The Wall Street Journal","KYIV, Ukraine‚ÄîUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky‚Äôs decision to replace his top general last week was arguably his most consequential choice since opting to stay in Kyiv rather than flee in the early days of Russia‚Äôs invasion.
After weeks of speculation, Zelensky dismissed Gen. Valeriy Zaluzhniy as commander in chief of the armed forces in the most significant shake-up of the country‚Äôs leadership in nearly two years of war.
The move is aimed at rebooting the country‚Äôs war effort, Zelensky said, as Ukrainian forces struggle to hold the line against Russia. But replacing a figure as popular as Zaluzhniy with Col. Gen. Oleksandr Syrskiy, who is seen as closer to the president, will bind Zelensky more tightly to battlefield decisions, making him more accountable for any failure, analysts said.

Those waiting for the artificial intelligence bubble to pop have been let down this earnings season.
