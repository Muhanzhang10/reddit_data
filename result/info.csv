Weird cocaine is known for it's soothing qualities
people who experience cocaine with a soothing effect often have adhd. source: I‘m an addiction counselor.
I did cocaine after high school a few times in the early 2000s (long before fent was in it) and each time it made me fall asleep. The people who were with me became chatty and low-key annoying so the nap was always nice.
I’ve never been diagnosed but it makes me wonder having read your post.
Weird. I have adhd and hated it...maybe it would sooth me after i got used to it.
Reminds me of how I knew of a guy who owned a food cart who would take a two hour lunch break where he would smoke a bunch of crack, eat a pizza pie, would take a nap, and then would wake up to go back to work again
This. I have adhd. Stimulants of any kind relax me. I've never tried cocaine but if I want to focus while feeling relaxed I'll down a red bull. Sativa strains of weed relax me where they hype others up.
BTW, I know some guys that used to work in the trading pits, it's an insane way to make a living!
As someone that has mild ADHD…can confirm lol
I can vouch for this being true. source: I have adhd and know what they mean.
It's not like they depict it on TV and in movies, and I really think they should stop depicting it like they do
Can confirm.
Very similar to adderall, it just makes you focus, no excess energy, just kind of emotionless and focused without the ""euphoria"" I was wondered what cocaine feels like for non add people it must feel great but for me it just meant medication and poor circulation side effects lol
4 grams will relax you before a speech, according to Super Hans
He was probably the least coked out person in that room.
Highly likely the traders were, too
So? Doesn’t mean he was wrong.
Did anybody say he was? Or do you draw random inferences from people's statement and then bother them about it so you can feel mighty?
Nah it was just irrelevant and borderline rude, seems you just want to argue in comments and be triggered and defensive

,"i always wondered.. all the yelling.. who they yelling at.. the other guys right? well for the other guy, are they hearing numbers? are they hearing the right numbers? how many people are just yelling at one man.. they have papers, what do those say? if it seems like a guy heard what ur yelling does he nod his head? he knows ur name .. ""ok mike i got it sell at 350"" how tf does this work?
I don’t think anyone other than the people who work there actually understand wtf is going on, it’s just bat shit craziness
They’re just trying to get their orders filled
With whom?
ok.. yes.. this seems right lol
I can't remember where I watched this, but there was like a documentary sort of thing where a guy who used to trade on the floor explained it. I think it might have been the Bernie Madoff doc on Netflix?
IIRC, he said he would get a call for an order, say for 100 shares of Microsoft buy or sell,. He would then frantically search around looking for someone to take the order on the opposite side, either selling shares to him or buying from him. Once he locked eyes with someone who would fulfill the order, they'd nod and write it down or whatever. I think that's essentially the gist of it, just a bunch of sellers and buyers chaotically trying to get their orders fulfilled. However in the hell this was organized in a coherent way is honestly impressive.
I was the person that, literally, ran the tickets across the floor to the other guy. It was insane. The late 90’s/early aughts were wild!
I would love to learn more about that. That’s really cool.
And floor fights. CBOT / CME used to have those every now and then.
Or the ""O'Hare trade"", go all in, last ditch effort. Place the order and go to the airport. Once at airport, call clerk and see if it moved in your favor. If so, return to the floor, if not, fly back home.
What do you think of Wolf of Wall Street?
Is it still like that or is it digitized now somehow?
I just remember watching Trading Places and thinking that they must’ve done this just for comedic effect in the movie. Nope 🤣
Is that the Tim Allen movie?
Lmao real world runescape before GE 😂
Computers pretty much got rid of the yelling. The only ones left are the people with old ass clients who still make phone calls
Yeah, it’s a lot more quiet now. It’s not what it was back in the day. Now they argue about how my fiber cord isn’t as fast as that guy’s.
I work in this industry, we used to run trading floors, now we run data centers. You're right it's all digital and you're right, people will argue about quarter of an inch on a fiber patch when the data is travelling at the speed of light. It's not measurable by science, but they are screaming at our techs because we didn't trim the cable close enough.
It’s a pit. The guy with two phones gets an order from his client, he tells a runner who tell a guy at the edge of the pit, who then tells it out. Something like 100something for Nov. they are looking to fill that order, the other rabid people are then yelling that they have 100something in Nov, all of the yelling a price, deal, insider cues, etc. And multiple exchanges like this all over one another.
You should post in ELI5 and report back
Came here to ask the same thing and see it hasn’t been answered yet. Now I’m beginning to think the people in the videos aren’t people who work there but just crazed investors and brokers who come there to scream their wishes into the void hoping the stock Gods hear their pleas.
Like watching a sporting event, but they're the most rabid fans I've ever seen
They're all brokers looking to match their buy or sell with someone on the other side. Then they're trying to signal runners who will run the trade in.
There was also a comical amount of cocaine so everyone was really over hyped. The stories from the guys who worked the floor are so much fun. Hookers with dedicated offices in the building, bathroom floors turned white from spilled drugs, people having sex in the catwalks, guys leaving with 25k in their pockets going straight to bars and spending it all that night.
In Chicago, those pits were all run by the mob so it really was the wild West.
I know some guys that used to work in the pits. There's hand signals for price and volume and, back in the day, they exchanged ""cards"" that were purchases or sells. End of the day, all cards must be accounted for without exception.
The old cards? Well that became what we call a ""ticker tape parade"" and they were used as confetti.
Man, I was born too late, I feel like this would have been the most awesome job ever.
I said this in another comment, but I work for a company that runs these floors, and some of the old guys are still around. Their stories are fantastic. Drugs were just everywhere, hookers were available anytime. Runners would get $1 per trade they ran in, but they'd get handed hundreds or thousands of trades at a time, sometimes with tips of hundreds. And after work, it was a party every night with everyone who struck it rich paying the tabs. It was all run by the mob, so it really was the wild west.
This legit made me laugh out loud. ""They have papers, what do those say?""
They’re not just yelling. They are using hand signals. Seems crazy, yes… but it works.
But haven't all these people been replaced by computers at this point? I thought ""open outcry"" went the way of the dinosaurs...? 🦖
Well, all I know is it has something to do with The Duke Brothers, Orange juice futures, and Jamie Lee Curtis’ boobs.


…and is it all digital by now? Who does business with little pieces of paper in 2024??😂
Ok. I worked on the floor of an exchange and can answer some of your questions. The people holding lots of papers are brokers. They fill orders for other people. The others are independent traders or market makers.
Each pit trades a different product. So the people trading treasury bonds wouldn’t be in the same pit as people trading euros.
They are shouting very simple things “100 lots at 4” or something . Just the amount and price. Small traders and brokers are near the bigger traders they tend to trade with.
Hand signals are used too. An outward hard means selling, inwards buying. Numbers are indicated by fingers and hand position. Brokerage houses used to have hand signals too but weren’t used often because everybody knows everyone
After trading ends traders reconcile their trades . The exchange has a committee person for each put to arbitrate any minor problems between traders. Major oroblems go to the exchange.

,"I wonder how rich or poor all those people are now.
I think the real takeaway here is that this built a middle class. And upper middle class. It gave regular people from nothing a chance to make a little money and taste a better life. It didn’t last long, and most people had to transition to computers or leave the industry all together.
When the floors closed it shut down a huge portion of middle class upward mobility.
These floors still exist, just more computers and fewer people.
Yea but it’s like maybe 5% of the people, they don’t exist like this video anymore.
But can’t the middle class just use Robinhood now, making it more accessible than ever before?
Apps like that are meant to take advantage of lazy people who have no idea what they’re doing.

This was jobs created by the process of trading, annual salaries made from the industry that traded. Not just individual traders. And these people aren’t using their own money, they work for people with the money. We made salaries, tips, bonuses…. Single trades in publicly traded companies isn’t even 1% of what happened on the floors.
built a middle class.
ELI5 how this was done.
You didn’t need college to make it. You could work right out of High School, move up, make 50,000 in the 90s. Come from rural areas into the city and “make it”. Come from poor families and make it, bring your friends in to make it… There were 5000+ people on each trading floor, 5 trading floors in Chicago and each bank had offices with at least 500 more staff members. The CBOT offices were fully staffed with Trading support jobs.. and 3 buildings on top of the trading floors, and the building around them all had offices too. For example BOA had grain offices, private offices, 10 year offices, options offices etc all in different buildings. Each bank, world wide banks, and small to large firms. It was an economy structure that made a middle class in Chicago.
Look up the Financial District in Chicago to see how big it was and now it’s not (picture that in every city with trading floors all over the world). It wasn’t tons of rich people. It was rich people adjacent…
IIRC That room was in the World Trade Towers sadly…
Edit: per the comment below me I am wrong! It’s the New York Stock Exchange Building.
Thats the floor of the stock exchange which is in the New York Stock Exchange Building a few blocks away from the WTC. Though a lot of stock brokerage companies had offices in the WTC, and thus were heavily effected by 9/11.
Thank you for the correction!


Robert is richer than all of the trade floor workers, combined. His criticisms are extremely “rich.”
He also grew up wealthy. I’m not saying his criticism isn’t valid, but I do think the sanctimonious disgust in a naked pursuit of wealth slaps a bit different when it’s coming from someone who is afforded the ability to offer scathing takes of raw capitalism because they’ve ironically profited off of it to such a degree that they actually don’t even recognize they’ve actually ascended beyond that level.
Exactly. He and his ilk have definitely ascended beyond the chase for the almighty dollar. Worries about making rent/mortgage, car payments, etc., are stresses they’ve never experienced, when born into it. And how about our dreams of financial security? They have publicists to handle the business ends of things and their “work” is driven by inflated egos.
He’s diatribe here shows two faces. Obviously this activist attack on raw capitalism, but also contempt for the rest of us. We’re all directly or indirectly connected to the traders on the floor. The system looks ugly, but it’s the only system we’ve got.
'How dare these ants try to reach my level in such an undignified way'
I read an article recently. It boiled down to ""Robert Downey Jr. is a great and serious actor: the stinking masses should be, but are not, grateful that he lowered himself to participate in their proletarian divertissements for a decade. But now, follow along as we see him re-orient himself towards the serious work of a master thespian that is his rightful due.""
I mean, a really good publicist. You can hardly pay for this shit. Except I guess you can
I have no respect for well off actors talking about wealth or greed. They get paid millions for something that ultimately is of little material benefit to society. When socialists talk of millionaires and billionaires only getting that wealthy because they stole it somehow, the few groups I think that applies to are this category of wealthy. Especially when you include that they're almost like a new aristocracy when you consider that most highly successful actors are related to people in the industry (i.e. the whole nepobaby thing).
Yeah it’s ironic coming from a guy who lives and works in Hollywood

,"Not everyone has a famous movie director father who just gives them an entry into Hollywood. Many of those floor traders are middle class guys from Long Island, the boroughs, and Jersey who are working for a living. I like Downey's films, and I'm astonished by his story of sobriety after overcoming serious drug addiction from which it appeared he might never recover. But when I see this clip what it looks like to me is some snotty Hollywood brat parachuting into another world for a few hours, passing judgement on people and a culture he doesn't know. Robert Downey Jr.'s current net worth is north of $500 million. Trust me, he's not averse to making money.
You nailed it. Well said.
I'm very curious to see how he'd respond to this clip, nowadays.
I'd guess he'd fully admit it doesn't hold up. His best defense was that he was young back then.
his comments are probably true though. majority of them are probably hungry for money(hence working there), some of the people also seem obnoxious to me in the video. the low iq part is questionable though. doesn't matter if RDJ is a brat or if he doesnt know the culture. you can observe and deduct based on the video.
You can observe and make criticisms, you can also be a hypocritical out of touch elite drug addicted celebrity who only got famous because of his father, with hundreds of millions of dollars made from Hollywood and all of its own slimy business dealings

,"The Last Party is a 1993 documentary film co-written by and starring Robert Downey Jr.
Interviews and commentary cover moments of history during the 1992 presidential campaigns and investigate the issues of the day with Downey's particular brand of off-beat humor and satire. Although Downey's political sympathies are clear in the film, he lampoons both Democrats and Republicans equally, and provides elements of general social commentary, as well. The film also provides a snap-shot of Robert Downey Jr., at a point in his life where he was falling into drug addiction that later led to an interruption in his career. (source: wikipedia)

,"Shankar Ramakrishnan and Sinead Cruise for Reuters;
Since late September, seven U.S. banks, including JPMorgan Chase and US Bancorp, have trimmed the risk of losses on mortgage, corporate and automobile loans using risk transfers - many for the first time, according to bank filings, term sheets, investor estimates and regulatory notices.
The trades, some of which price at double-digit yields, have attracted investors such as Ares, Blackstone, and PGGM.
The opening up of the U.S. market has boosted global volumes.
Issuing banks in the private sector sold off an estimated $25 billion of the risk of losses on loans totalling $300 billion globally in 2023, compared with $20 billion sold on $250 billion of loans in the previous year, according to Olivier Renault, head of risk sharing strategy at Pemberton Asset Management, which invests in non-investment grade debt on behalf of global institutional investors.
 
Official data on these trades is not public, but U.S banks are estimated to have placed around $7 billion of the $25 billion, on a portfolio of loans totalling around $72 billion, according to company filings, bank letters seeking regulatory approval and one large asset manager.
These deals have drawn some concern, including from U.S. lawmakers. While they can give banks additional capacity to lend and reallocate capital toward other growth initiatives and shareholder returns, they also spread the risk into the lightly-regulated shadow banking area.
""It is the nature of financial markets to push the envelope and then try and find that wrinkle to squeeze some more gain out of a particular type of asset,"" said Som-lok Leung, executive director of the trade group International Association of Credit Portfolio Managers.
The beginning of the end…
China re-wrote the playbook when Evergrande went under by not guaranteeing anyone with stake in it outside of China anything. What does this have to do with what’s going on here you probably are asking…
China did not guarantee any non-Chinese national anything because the losses in Evergrande were divided by the biggest financial institutions* over there and then assumed all the assets that came with owning their debt. In The US the top banks did the exact same thing with SVB and 1st Republic fiasco from last year and are just repeating that process here. To what extent the US Federal Gov is financially involved in all of this (at the tax payers expense) remains to be seen and it’s honestly unlikely the general public will know prior to a complete financial meltdown of ‘08s proportions.

Another bank subsidy America should kill off: The Federal Home Loan Banks offer loans to Wall Street that are too cheap,"























",2024-02-15T14:06:38.959Z,ONETRILLIONAMERICANS,4
,"Yet the new problems cast light on a deeper, structural problem with America’s financial sector: the role of the 11 Federal Home Loan Banks (FHLBs), a network of privately owned but government-sponsored lenders to banks. Many banks fund commercial real-estate investments with FHLB loans; as interest rates have risen and the financial system has wobbled, the FHLBs’ role has further grown in importance. New York Community Bank has long relied on loans from FHLBs and as of December 31st they funded nearly 20% of its $116bn balance-sheet.

Ample liquidity sounds like a good thing, especially in a pinch. One problem is that it comes too cheap. The FHLBs fund their loans by selling their debt to investors (after the Treasury, they are the world’s second-biggest issuers of dollar-denominated bonds). They are owned by their member institutions but their debt is presumed by investors to be all but guaranteed by the government. They are also exempt from some taxes, among other privileges. The result is their debt trades at a similar yield to Treasuries, allowing the FHLBs to lend at below-market interest rates to banks, which also share in the FHLBs’ profits. In all the FHLBs dole out an implicit subsidy that researchers valued at around $5.5bn in 2022, when the FHLBs were smaller than they are today.
To the system’s cheerleaders the subsidy, some of which is passed on to everyday borrowers, looks like money for nothing. The FHLBs have never called on the public purse directly, in part because they only make secured loans. The trouble is that, in a crisis, the availability of FHLB funding probably postpones the moment at which banks in trouble turn to the Federal Reserve. Banks dislike going cap in hand to the Fed, which is regarded as a sign of weakness, when FHLB loans, which carry no such stigma, are available. Even rock-solid banks borrow from the FHLBs as a matter of course, in part because doing so brings some regulatory advantages.
But keeping out the Fed has consequences. An asset pledged as security cannot later be sold by regulators to compensate remaining depositors, so emergency lending to a bank can raise the costs of winding it up should it fail. As a result, central banks are supposed to lend only cautiously and at a penalty interest rate. The FHLBs appear to lend freely. SVB, as it gradually lost depositors in 2022, borrowed $15bn from the FHLB system. First Republic, another bank that failed last year, had borrowed $28bn as of March 31st. Had those banks turned to the Fed sooner, red flags might have gone up—in time, perhaps, to forestall the crisis that later struck.
Many politicians approve of the FHLBs because they must use 10% of their earnings to fund affordable housing initiatives (and have volunteered more). But the government can fund worthwhile projects directly. The FHLBs’ privileged status increasingly looks like a relic and the system’s regulators are pondering reforms to the system. They should work with Congress to remove the various taxpayer-backed privileges FHLBs enjoy and allow market forces to determine their role. Central banking should be left to the central bank.

,"tldr; Wall Street firms anticipate the potential approval of a spot Ethereum ETF by the SEC in May. The crypto industry and securities lawyers are optimistic, citing the precedent set by the approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs. Skeptics, however, question Ethereum's legal status and institutional support. The SEC's previous approval of Bitcoin ETFs, based on the CME Bitcoin futures market's resistance to manipulation, may pave the way for an Ethereum ETF. Despite the optimism, some believe approval may not occur until after the November election.

,"Holy shot. It’s like an apartment complex, but with houses. Cries in poor
Yup. Unfortunately I fully expect this to become more and more common. Wall Street wants to ensure we never own anything.
The subscription formula is working well for streaming services and software. Never expected it for housing.
It's already quite common. Come on up and visit Natomas. Shit is rented before the houses are even finished.
And most of our reps are happy to provide the legal means to do so.
I thought everyone’s mantra was build build build. Who cares who built it if it’s more housing, right? More supply regardless of who owns it is better.
You are getting down voted, but you are correct. We need a lot more housing supply to correct the market
Yup, they built one of these “communities” over in Natomas last year. It was really sad when I drove by shortly before they were finished and saw the “NEW HOMES FOR RENT” banner.
Have they been renting out all their properties? I’d be interested to see how it works out. Of course, I hope they go bankrupt
I have no idea, I just see it from the freeway. I’ve seen a couple cars, but it doesn’t seem as busy as it should for the number of units there are.
When you put it this way… why is it that these rental homes are disliked so much more than apartment complexes? They’re both the same idea - built to rent. And they both could have been built to own instead - either a SFH families could buy, or a condo which is basically an owned apartment.
I would rather own a house than an apartment. I think it’s just culture and tradition that apartments are for renting and houses are for ownership. Now there’s less chance for ownership as these new developments are for renting out. Thoughts.
Absolutely, I would rather own a house too. When I was younger and making my first home purchase, all I could afford was a one bedroom condo. It fit better at the time than home ownership anyways.

Absolutely, I would rather own a house too. When I was younger and making my first home purchase, all I could afford was a one bedroom condo. It fit better at the time than home ownership anyways.

Over 12,000 lobbyists calling on 535 members of congress. They spend over $4 billion a year to influence and shape legislation to benefit their business interests.
In 2022, corporations in the U.S. made profits of around 3.5 trillion U.S. dollars. This indicates significant growth since 2000, when corporate profits totaled 786 billion U.S. dollars. The corporate profits are defined as the net income of corporations in the National Income and Product Accounts (NIPA). That’s about a 445% increase.
Median household income in the United States from 1990 to 2022 grew from $61k to $75k about 23%.
Profits are unpaid wages. And now we have a generation of renters. That’s how we got here.

,"This just in consumers suck and it's far easier to deal with businesses and fleet sales. Higher margins, fewer questions asked, and you can offer expensive, expensive support. Same goes for any industry.
Now I wouldn't say ""forget tesla"" makes sense, just as you wouldn't ""forget apple"" just because AWS and Nvidia exist. Of course consumer electronics and cars for your average Joe are going to continue to sell. It's just its far, far easier to grow in enterprise.
People ask ""why did ford discontinue every sedan and hatchback"" this is the reason.
This just in consumers suck and it's far easier to deal with businesses and fleet sales. Higher margins, fewer questions asked, and you can offer expensive, expensive support.
Yeah this sounds like blaming the consumer for the reason their EV rollout isn't going the way they hoped.
Jim Farley on Thursday urged Wall Street to forget about Tesla and its FSD driver-assistance systems as the future of the auto industry, arguing investors should instead focus on the Detroit automaker’s “Pro” fleet business...Ford has said it expects revenue from telematics and other non-traditional subscription services to increase to $2,000 per vehicle annually, or about $167 a month, for Ford Pro in the years ahead.
And this sounds like ""you'll own nothing and like it.""
It is blaming the consumer, and they have made horribly uncompetitive EVs thus far, but their fleet sales for said EVs actually aren't too bad. Consumers have unique needs, want range and features, want value for their money, crosshop which is more than fair.But NYPD don't care, they have mach-e's for everything now, and frankly fact of the matter is people eat up subscriptions and they are extremely profitable.
It kinda sucks that ford went this direction but all I'm saying is looking at the numbers you can't really blame them and if I was at the helm I can't say I'd run the company any differently.
Apart from making a mustang wagon with a manual of course.
they have made horribly uncompetitive EVs thus far
Have they? I'm kind of out of the loop regarding the F150 Lightning, but I thought the Mach E was fairly competitive. Did something change?
From the fleet side their software gives all the telemetry on maintenance, location, fuel usage, etc that the business wants/needs for better vehicle management. Also most businesses prefer to have leases instead of outright purchasing for a myriad of reasons. It’s not really a “you own nothing and like it situation”.
Fair enough on the telemetry. But what I meant is more reading between the lines on the fundamentals of the argument. At face value, the future Tesla is promoting is one of private ownership where the car takes over the basics of driving for the occupants. Ford is saying the future of the industry lies not in that vision, but in one where fleet sales and subscriptions dominate. The only way that happens is if Ford Pro encroaches on the private ownership model.
Maybe I'm misunderstanding and Farley only meant that Ford Pro will be more profitable long-term than Tesla and FSD. But neither Farley's comments nor the article make it clear if that's the case.
Yeah businesses tend to take the perspective of ""I don't own it but still get the utility? Awesome, upkeep and management can be your problem then.""
and other non-traditional subscription services
This is referring to their fleet products, specifically logistics and fleet management software. They're not talking about heated seat subscriptions.
“Could it be that we’re making shitty products people don’t want? No it’s people that are stupid for buying other EVs”
Your flair is like a Best Hits of Honda. You should add a Goldwing.
Don't worry, I already have an '07 CBR600RR. Flair was just a little too big already. Tried the goldwing but I think I like bikes for the raw thrill, you gotta be on your toes at all times, and the glowing is a bit too luxurious lol.
I have considered an RC51 though, and am trying to import either an NSR/MC28 or cbr200RR but finding a clean example is quite the challenge nowadays :(
So basically the competition is too good in the passenger segment
It's also that last mile delivery for just about everything is massively important today as shopping across every industry moves almost exclusively online, and offering a logistics platform to manage those fleets could be a massive boon to small/medium businesses.
Realistically the passenger car market in the US is completely saturated and zoomers and alpha are likely looking at going car-free and relying on public transport or MaaS, so acquisition cost is huge for consumer, but fleets are probably still growing substantially and that's easier to capitalise on.",2024-02-15T18:21:10.614Z,hi_im_bored13,11.1

It’s because some companies, especially government funded ones benefit come tax time for purchasing electric or “clean burning” vehicles. The electric F-150 and the electric Transit is literally printing money for Fords fleet sales.
Just had an electric Ford Transit deliver my groceries (Walmart). It’s a total no brainer and companies want them.

Gonna need a source for the radiation claim
If gamma and beta emitting isotopes were left so unshielded in DOE facilities that they can get through the metal bodies of fleet vehicles and affect the batteries within, Li ion degradation would be least of our worries.

Do they report those vehicles through their pro segment? For whatever reason, I thought they reported them up through their EV segment.

Pretty sure all F-150 Lighting Pros and E-Transits sold through the Pro arm report as Pro fleet sales.
For the lightnings the pro segment is still going to offer support, telemetry, charging management and installation, etc. for those vehicles which is pretty good money. I believe the transit is reported as part of pro though.

,"Is this another business plan where the company outsources its core competencies?
I'm convinced that the car industry is headed down the same path as computers. A handful of companies possess all the expertise, producing components for everybody. On the consumer side you get dozens of brands focusing on little more than visual design, marketing and subscription services.
Ford talks a lot of smack for a company that is already entirely dependent on the Koreans for their EV platforms. I couldn't care less about Tesla, but at least they develop all their tech in house. What makes Ford's trucks any more compelling than the dozen other competitors on the market? Even in that space others are making more compelling progress.
Already has been, the automakers are like Boeing in that they're system integrators*; most of the parts in cars are bought from suppliers... the mach e/Lightning's powertrain is pretty much all from Magna International for example
in fact they're going the other way in one major component,most of the large automakers now do infotainment in house , which Ford was the first to do out of the majors following the failure of Sync 2

,"How about as consumers we forget Wall Street. We don’t let Wall Street dictate our decisions and lives. Personally Ford used to be great. I loved Ford cars. But they listened to Wall Street and killed all sedans and went to trucks and SUV’s. And now are killing SUV’s. They’re killing the Ford Edge. So the Ford line up will be trucks, the Explorer, Escape and Mustang ? Oh sorry the Bronco too. And they wonder why they aren’t making money. I dunno, when your line-up consists of mostly trucks. Then when people live in cities want to drive around they won’t be picking huge trucks. A nice sedan or crossover would be better and why Honda, Toyota, Mazda and VW are still selling sedans. But seems like Ford is all in on trucks.
VW is barely keeping the Jetta alive, if the Taos wasn’t a half baked piece of shit and sold I’m sure the Jetta would be dead by now. As it is the Passat which used to be a industry staple has been dead since 2020.
The Edge is going away because most buyers opt for the Explorer nowadays. The Edge served its purpose during the recession when it was first unveiled when pockets were tighter and the Explorer was still a body on frame gas guzzler.
The Edge was/is great and used to be priced mid range. They killed it by pricing it at $60K. Why pay $60K for an Edge when for the extra $10K you get the Explorer or can get a Bronco for $60K ? Ford axed all Lincoln cars but sells Lincoln sedans in China. And they look amazing. Ford used to sell amazing cars in Europe and could have sold them in here in America. But never took the steps to bring them here. We missed out on some great vehicles. If Ford took the VW approach and shared more vehicles globally, they could have bigger profits and we would have some greats cars here.
And it does suck, the Passat was a great car. But the Jetta is about the same size now, so was there a need for it ? If they kept the sizes separated it woulda worked better. But one of the car industries biggest issues is models growing bigger and into the next segment. I mean a Civic is the size of an Accord now. The Civic was a compact sedan and now it’s a Midsize. The Accord was a midsize and now is a full size. Manufacturers have literally over built/sized the models out of the segments that they used to dominate.
Escape would be axed in future too. However, they’re also deleting low roof car models in Europe. Fiesta is no longer existence, and Focus would be gone very soon, only Puma is their main European model.
Don’t blame they killing all of low roof models, blame today’s car market. It’s happening in most world. More people just don’t buy low roof cars.",2024-02-15T20:33:21.066Z,gwh811,11.6

Oh they'll vote for infrastructure bills. The ones that make them money. My state overwhelmingly voted no on multiple infrastructure bills that would help EVERYONE. Then they overwhelmingly voted yes on building a new turnpike that only benefits them. They also voted to subsidize with our tax dollars a private project for some rich asshole from Nevada that would build TWO entertainment districts in my city with all the profits going to the state and the vast majority going to the rich guy. TWO OF THEM. One of them is going to built after they demolish the ONLY MENTAL HEALTH FACILITY WITHIN 50 MILES. The only thing this going to do for the people that live is create more low paying shit jobs and it will raise our rents even more. It's a college town so I've been hearing this project is being done for out of state students that come here for schooling. Which is not entirely unbelievable since almost 25% of our housing here is now student housing(apartments) where you rent the room and share everything else, but for some reason we can't do proper zoning to build more affordable single family homes and homes that are 1 or two bedrooms.

Fun fact: The US highway system is the most economically taxing engineering undertaking in the entirety of human history. Funded entirely through the government. In that respect it's the most communist project ever.

But my truck goes brrrrrr and has thin blue line stickers
An auto designed to be unnecessarily overbuilt due in part to government regulations, toting a sticker aggrandizing a government organization? Filthy commie :P
you want me to use a train? thats taking away my freedom to drive where i want.
i can drive to the piggly wiggly, and then the drive thru cocktail bar across the county line. cant do that in a train
Wait, which amendment of the constitution included the automobile, again? Must be in there somewhere to retain R support.
There's only one amendment they care about, so it must be the second
The highways were funded because the military needed national highways to be able to move trucks and equipment. Luckily they let civilians drive on it, too. Politics is weird.
The government has no money and funds nothing. Even when the Fed prints money adding to the national debt, it deflates the value of the USD.
Your money you pay in taxes funds things. The government has none of their own money.
Disgusting commies and their make-believe funny money, makes me sick.
No no.no. it was not funded ny the government. The governmemt makes no money. It was funded by immorally taken funds from peoples checks. The only taxes i fully agree with are sales taxes(including gas taxes) and corprate taxes.
Wow every time you point to communism's evils, the pinkos come out of the woodwork with ""That's not true communism!!1!"" STFU commie, I know socialism when I see it!
And Eisenhower couldn’t even sell it as a jobs program. What finally made it work was convincing Congress they would serve as emergency landing strips for aircraft in the event of a nuclear attack and it was necessary in our fight for nuclear preparedness and superiority.
I'm doing a bit, sorry.
Can you explain that a little more? What makes the roads so expensive? (I genuinely don't know what you're talking about.)
Source? By 2020 China had built 25000 miles of high Speed rail, and adding another 4000 each year, the U.S. highway System hás 48000 miles. On average railways cost close to double of roads.
On average railways cost close to double of roads.
Where does that come from? I have heard the inverse suggested, though I'm guessing the comparison varies widely depending on where you're trying to build out miles. I could maybe see that in US, though not in China. Especially not in the modular fashion that China cranks out their railways.
Anyway to be honest I don't know for sure that China hasn't overtaken the Interstate System yet on cost, though I would still bet on the Interstate System being more expensive when adjusted for inflation. The original < 43,000-mile build out, excluding supporting routes and pre-existing sections, was a bit over $600 billion in today's dollars, and since then at least another 5,000 miles have been added, at what cost I don't know.
I'd like to include maintenance cost as rail is much cheaper to maintain than expressways, but that wouldn't be fair as the US system is so old and China's is so new.
I got some of this from the US interstate wiki page, but it's frustrating trying to find honest stats about these things that don't come from attentive users on social media crunching numbers for you from sources that don't directly show those numbers, as such information isn't very citable.
This is also very selective. Easy enough to find some flooded metro station in China and compare it to the modern architecture and futurism of the (relatively) new World Trade Center Station to try to make the opposite point. It would be an equally facile way to do so

Maybe the poor states should pull themselves up by their bootstraps since most are republican states and despise the federal government anyway. Maybe places like NY shouldn't pay into federal taxes if it's gonna be wasted on states that can't afford to prop themselves up.
Maybe NY should stop subsidizing welfare states then?

Can you explain that a little more? What makes the roads so expensive? (I genuinely don't know what you're talking about.)
Source? By 2020 China had built 25000 miles of high Speed rail, and adding another 4000 each year, the U.S. highway System hás 48000 miles. On average railways cost close to double of roads.
On average railways cost close to double of roads.
Where does that come from? I have heard the inverse suggested, though I'm guessing the comparison varies widely depending on where you're trying to build out miles. I could maybe see that in US, though not in China. Especially not in the modular fashion that China cranks out their railways.
Anyway to be honest I don't know for sure that China hasn't overtaken the Interstate System yet on cost, though I would still bet on the Interstate System being more expensive when adjusted for inflation. The original < 43,000-mile build out, excluding supporting routes and pre-existing sections, was a bit over $600 billion in today's dollars, and since then at least another 5,000 miles have been added, at what cost I don't know.
I'd like to include maintenance cost as rail is much cheaper to maintain than expressways, but that wouldn't be fair as the US system is so old and China's is so new.

No because that's pure communism

""Ok, let's build public transportation"" ""No, that's CoMMuNiSM""
Reminds me of people who argued against continuing the space program in the 70s saying we should spend that money improving people’s lives. So we ended it, and surprise surprise, nothing was spent improving people’s lives.
That's not true. Many politicians' lives improved.
People also didn't realize that many of the technological breakthroughs and new inventions made during the space program HAVE improved peoples lives, especially in computing and the medical industry.
The reality is that entities like Fox News or Trump use the credulity (and often sheer stupidity) of their audience to manipulate them using biased/partial information or sometimes even lies that stimulate their fear. This has always been the case, and won’t stop anytime soon.

Democrats: “We are giving $100 million dollars to Detroit to help build infrastructure for underprivileged minorities.”
Results: Building EV charging stations for white upper-middle class EV owners.
From what I heard a lot of the money wasn't even spent on things regarding the charging stations (such as the workers and materials to make said charging stations).
Now, I'm not against the democratic party, they are, by far, the least worse option of the 2, especially if they actually do stuff instead of saying they're gonna do it.
The Indiana state legislature literally banned light rail and Tennessee banned Bus lanes that load and unload in the center lane because one of the cities was planning to use that design.
Their effortless hypocrisy will never cease to amaze me.
One day they’ll be shitting on public transit how it’s anti-freedom and just creates problems with “undesirable people”
And then they’ll talk about how out dated our public transit infrastructure is.
The reason we don’t have nice things is because we treat nice things provided by the government as socialism.
It's just like the Tucker Carlson recent Russia video lol he was amazed at the public services the Soviets built while simultaneously shitting on every American government program.
It's not hypocrisy they're just extremely stupid
Yup. The shitty infrastructure in the US came 100% from Republicans blocking efforts to improve it.
Family member posted a video breaking down of what the Ukrainian assistance ""would"" have fixed in the US if the money stayed in the US. Yet I am the bad guy when I point out that her guys keep voting everything down that would go a tiny way to start fixing it.
How does sending already build weapons to Ukraine impact infrastructure construction in America?
Anybody who claims sending Ukraine weapons is preventing America from spending money on its citizens in a moron.
Idk how this works so correct me if I’m wrong, but wouldn’t sending supply out mean more gets produced down the line to resupply? Meanwhile if the US didn’t send stuff then they’d just be sitting in a depot somewhere and the producers are less incentivized to make more stuff in the long run if it keeps up.
While true that the weapons are already built; and the money is already spent; its not like the contracts aren't already in place to spend the money to replace the weapons that we gave away... if we didn't have to replace them we could use that money for other stuff....like building different weapons...(you didn't really think I was going to say infrastructure did you?)
Or a Russian Troll in a cell phone farm most likely. I am amazed that people get spun up and how easy it is to shape US voter perception that the person giving you info is another American.
Yeah that money would just end up in some rich guys pockets. But heads up ur not alone with it. We got the same idiots in Europe too 😭
when has a repub congress spent money on ""people"" as opposed to massive tax cuts for the wealthy. To be fair they gave tax cuts peons, but those expire next year.. and the 1% tax cuts continue....
The ""money"" that goes to ukraine is mostly in form of a missiles and bullets and humvees. Idk how you improve infrastructure with a missile
Save on bulldozer leases
""We shouldn't be sending money to Ukraine, we should fix up our country!""
""Ok, like new rail systems and better, more sustainable energy infrastructure?""
""No we shouldn't pay for that stuff, there are homeless veterans we should take care of first!""
""Oh, so we should put more resources towards social safety nets and healthcare access to better transition veterans to civilian life?""
""Hell no, I'm not paying for some freeloaders to sit on the couch all day! If they want healthcare, they can get a job!""
We do always find it funny when the politicians and their supporters exclaim how that money could be used here, but then get livid about it being used here.
There's also a bunch of people mad about a non-existent open boarder policy while also cheering on Republicans shooting down their own dumbass America First type immigration bill. You just can't win with some people.
Democrats have the best track record ever with not throwing money away, so it must be the Republicans....
Maybe they should stop paying people in NY, who aren't citizens, a stipend every month. Makes too much sense to fix a problem though, let's just throw money away and make another one.
Don't forget about private interest groups constantly lobbying in their favor. The Koch brothers were and are (now just the one brother) notorious for helping shoot down efforts to improve mass transit among other things.
non American here. why would the GOP want to block efforts to improve transportation? surely that could only be a good thing?
Because the improvement initiatives need to be paid for, and that means the rich end up paying more taxes. And that's something Republicans oppose because communism or something.
Same reason the US doesn't have universal healthcare.
Republicans: ""Our government doesn't work! Elect me so I can prove it!""
Wealthier Americans have dependable transportation already so republicans see public transportation as a handout to the poor.
Well yeah, we have to spend that money ResponsiblyTM
Funny, in Massachusetts we have a lock on pretty much very level of government and our public transportation keeps getting worse - must be those republicans blocking it.
Let me guess. You have no idea what’s going on in us poltics
I mean the argument they are making in this post is a false equivalency. Any underground subway system can flood during heavy rains….they’re underground. Here’s a picture of grand central station in NYC and here’s a flooded Chinese train station. If you look at these two what conclusion would you draw?
What conclusion would I draw? God dam chinese government can't even build subway stations! looks at grand central terminal See look how good the USA is!
Never mind that grand central station is not actually underground of course....
Conservatives don’t even vote for things they actually want, let alone the things they pretend to want. The entire goal of the party is to erode the protective power of government and leave a vacuum to be filled by those with money and weapons.
Where I live the Conservative party came up with a carbon tax plan. The centrist party was essentially like ""fine, we'll use that since they won't agree to anything else.""
The Conservative party has spent all of the time since telling everyone how it's a plan that could have only been cooked up by Satan in a bathtub.
Their own plan. Terrible, useless, demonic... if anyone else gets credit for it at least.
That's essentially what happened here with ""Obamacare."" It was originally a Republican healthcare plan that Democrats adopted as a compromise, then Republicans started demonizing it nonstop.
Conservatives everywhere use this bad faith strategy of getting people angry about anything and everything, but the sad part is that it actually works. Democrats lost a lot of seats in Congress after Obamacare was approved.
Fact Check: ✓ True!
Mitt Romney, when he was Governor (R) of Massachusetts, got a state health care package passed. He was so proud of it, he gave it prominence in his official state portrait (item 3 in the photo, below). And then, when he ran for president, he had to run against and denounce Obamacare which had done at the Federal level exactly what he did at the State level!

https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2011/10/backdrop-backstory--mitt-romneys-official-portrait-edition
Don't forget the other half of the story. Obama and the Democrats nixed the public option to attempt to make it appealing to Republicans, who demonized it regardless.
Then the Republicans had nothing in the pipe when Trump got elected after all that talk about repealing the ACA.
It blows my mind people keep voting for politicians that have no policy other than to prove that politicians are useless and to self-fulfill their prophecies about the government being ineffective at things like education or whatever by making it as useless as they can.
More than that, their goal is to destroy the federal government so that they can insert themselves into the power vacuum and place a ""Red Caeser"" into power.
It has become news recently due to the ""Project 2025"", but it's actually been in the works for decades.
4 years of infrastructure week and it’s still not enough for them!

I’m sure some buddies got contracts from the government.


No. They love China and Russia. They want communism! Wait, no. That's socialism. They want... WTF do they even want?? Do they know?
Republicans: China's subways are so much better than ours!
Everyone: Okay so let's spend billions updating them
Republicans: No that's socialism
No no, right wingers want to complain until given power, then do nothing with the power except consolidate more power.
It’s their classic tactic; defund and deregulate and then surprised pikachu face when agencies don’t work that turns into woman mad at cat
You're assuming they're researching the policies of who they vote for.
Meh, they'll just claim that socialized transportation is the failure and the key to eternal-growth utopia is to privatize it. Capitalism for the win, right?

Reminds me of people who argued against continuing the space program in the 70s saying we should spend that money improving people’s lives. So we ended it, and surprise surprise, nothing was spent improving people’s lives.
That's not true. Many politicians' lives improved.
People also didn't realize that many of the technological breakthroughs and new inventions made during the space program HAVE improved peoples lives, especially in computing and the medical industry.
The reality is that entities like Fox News or Trump use the credulity (and often sheer stupidity) of their audience to manipulate them using biased/partial information or sometimes even lies that stimulate their fear. This has always been the case, and won’t stop anytime soon.

How does sending already build weapons to Ukraine impact infrastructure construction in America?
Anybody who claims sending Ukraine weapons is preventing America from spending money on its citizens in a moron.
Idk how this works so correct me if I’m wrong, but wouldn’t sending supply out mean more gets produced down the line to resupply? Meanwhile if the US didn’t send stuff then they’d just be sitting in a depot somewhere and the producers are less incentivized to make more stuff in the long run if it keeps up.
While true that the weapons are already built; and the money is already spent; its not like the contracts aren't already in place to spend the money to replace the weapons that we gave away... if we didn't have to replace them we could use that money for other stuff....like building different weapons...(you didn't really think I was going to say infrastructure did you?)
Or a Russian Troll in a cell phone farm most likely. I am amazed that people get spun up and how easy it is to shape US voter perception that the person giving you info is another American.
Yeah that money would just end up in some rich guys pockets. But heads up ur not alone with it. We got the same idiots in Europe too 😭

Maybe they should stop paying people in NY, who aren't citizens, a stipend every month. Makes too much sense to fix a problem though, let's just throw money away and make another one.
Don't forget about private interest groups constantly lobbying in their favor. The Koch brothers were and are (now just the one brother) notorious for helping shoot down efforts to improve mass transit among other things.
non American here. why would the GOP want to block efforts to improve transportation? surely that could only be a good thing?
Because the improvement initiatives need to be paid for, and that means the rich end up paying more taxes. And that's something Republicans oppose because communism or something.
Same reason the US doesn't have universal healthcare.
Republicans: ""Our government doesn't work! Elect me so I can prove it!""
Wealthier Americans have dependable transportation already so republicans see public transportation as a handout to the poor.

,"Conservatives don’t even vote for things they actually want, let alone the things they pretend to want. The entire goal of the party is to erode the protective power of government and leave a vacuum to be filled by those with money and weapons.
Where I live the Conservative party came up with a carbon tax plan. The centrist party was essentially like ""fine, we'll use that since they won't agree to anything else.""
The Conservative party has spent all of the time since telling everyone how it's a plan that could have only been cooked up by Satan in a bathtub.
Their own plan. Terrible, useless, demonic... if anyone else gets credit for it at least.
That's essentially what happened here with ""Obamacare."" It was originally a Republican healthcare plan that Democrats adopted as a compromise, then Republicans started demonizing it nonstop.
Conservatives everywhere use this bad faith strategy of getting people angry about anything and everything, but the sad part is that it actually works. Democrats lost a lot of seats in Congress after Obamacare was approved.
Fact Check: ✓ True!
Mitt Romney, when he was Governor (R) of Massachusetts, got a state health care package passed. He was so proud of it, he gave it prominence in his official state portrait (item 3 in the photo, below). And then, when he ran for president, he had to run against and denounce Obamacare which had done at the Federal level exactly what he did at the State level!

https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2011/10/backdrop-backstory--mitt-romneys-official-portrait-edition
Don't forget the other half of the story. Obama and the Democrats nixed the public option to attempt to make it appealing to Republicans, who demonized it regardless.
Then the Republicans had nothing in the pipe when Trump got elected after all that talk about repealing the ACA.

,"Where I live the Conservative party came up with a carbon tax plan. The centrist party was essentially like ""fine, we'll use that since they won't agree to anything else.""
The Conservative party has spent all of the time since telling everyone how it's a plan that could have only been cooked up by Satan in a bathtub.
Their own plan. Terrible, useless, demonic... if anyone else gets credit for it at least.
That's essentially what happened here with ""Obamacare."" It was originally a Republican healthcare plan that Democrats adopted as a compromise, then Republicans started demonizing it nonstop.
Conservatives everywhere use this bad faith strategy of getting people angry about anything and everything, but the sad part is that it actually works. Democrats lost a lot of seats in Congress after Obamacare was approved.

Mitt Romney, when he was Governor (R) of Massachusetts, got a state health care package passed. He was so proud of it, he gave it prominence in his official state portrait (item 3 in the photo, below).

,"It's well established that the US has shit for public transportation. Talk to your representatives who have their throats firmly gripping the cocks of the oil industry that wants to keep it that way.
I swear if more Americans could experience the convenience of high quality public transportation we’d be building high speed rail at a breakneck speed. Every time I visit a European country and use their rail systems it makes me depressed that we don’t have anything like it. Trains every hour or two that haul ass at a couple hundred mph with a ride smooth as glass.
Or being in London and experience their every 1-2 minute train. Our dumb asses ran to catch the train and one member of my group got on and the rest didn’t. Then we look up and see the next train is in 1 minute. My city trains are 20-60 minutes apart lol
Yeah, brits like to moan about their trains but they’re still on another level to the US. Having a huge country should mean a robust rail network, not a non-existent one!
Come to anywhere in England that isn't London and 20 minutes between trains seems like a luxury.
I'm in the North and there's 3 trains per hour between 2 major cities. Are they 20 mintues apart from eachother? No. They are all between 40 and 50 minutes past the hour. So if you show up at 51 minutes past the hour, you've got to wait 50 minutes for the next train.
If you show up at 40 minutes past the hour, there's 3 trains within the next 10 mintues.
Fuck the UK's shitty rail transport that is crap (and overpriced at around £1 every minute travelled) everywhere outside of London.
The great transport in London is at the expense the rest of the UK.
Check the history of UK rail, it's an interesting read. It was basically a collection of bankrupt railways that got bought up and stitched together.
Londoner here. We complain when the next train is more than 3 mins away.
New York is not far off from that. Trains every 3-5 mins usually
I was in London in October I was impressed by the public transportation system
Not sure it’s fair comparing a 1,000 year old capital city to your podunk town though. The DC metro, small compared to NYC, runs trains about every 6 minutes in rush hour (pre-pandemic), tough to do more than that because the train has to pull in, offload, unload, then clear out before the next train arrives.
The photo above is comparing a NYC subway during an emergency (likely a hurricane in progress) to a newly built showcase station that will likely fall to shit in 5 years because of cheap materials and lack of maintenance. It’s 100% a Russian disinformation campaign.
Ahh. I live in Boston. Literally consider one of the most publicly accessible city in the USA lol. Our subway has no real schedule they come when they come. They mostly range 20-60 minutes apart and then suddenly there is one 5 minutes apart lol.
This sounds like the red line in Boston.
Your city has trains?
Yeah like for what it's worth, the public transit near my house right outside of a big American city is halfway decent, it takes me exactly where I need to go quickly.
But the bus comes once an hour and sometimes will be so late you'll miss it from a connection, and that just destroys your day's schedule, and generally results in taking an Uber/cab some of the way.
When I used to live outside of San Francisco, it would've cost me more to take public transit than drive and pay for bridge toll (9$) + parking (12$) and take about three hours each way.
You most definetly have not been to Hungary. Our trains are late by a collective time of 4 years each year.
i have been to hungary. great food, shitty politics
Fax brother, spit you shit indeed.
(Transalation: True)
With all that great food you wouldn't think they would be...
Glad to see improvement.
I visited Hungary once via train from Hessen, Germany. I was young and a cigarette smoker. As the train rolled in to the station in Budapest, I was anxious for a smoke (hours without). I looked up to see no smoking signs through the train windows. Big sad. Once the doors opened, I saw a taxi driver and a bag helper on the indoor platform. The no smoking sign was visible just over their shoulders. They both had lit cigarettes in their mouths. I lit up as soon as they had my bags in hand. In that moment, I knew I was going to love Hungary!
I went to China for my first time a couple months ago and their public transportation left quite an impression on me. Coming back to the U.S. felt like there was a giant hole missing.
Bullet trains seem like something that would be extremely convenient
Yeah having been to both the USA and China, I have to say China's trains are some of the best I've ever been on, both metro and HSR. I haven't been to Japan to compare but it's at least as good as what I've used in Europe.

Have you used trams in urban settings?
They are a marvel - we have a few that are used hundred thousand times daily. I can't fathom how much space the same amount of trips would take in cars
I can't fathom how much space the same amount of trips would take in cars
Not only is that reducing the number of cars on the road, it's giving people who shouldn't be driving a reason not to. If there were more bus routes near bars that could take people home, we'd likely have far fewer DUIs here in the states.
I'm a fan of the Singaporean train and tram system too. They got that rocking with convenience and affordability.
It probably helps when your entire country is a single city.
It's similar to Tokyo though. And Tokyo itself is way bigger than Singapore in its entirety.
Nah man, as a Singaporean, the train system here isn't as efficient as other countries because we are too small. In fact if you know how to navigate the bus system here, depending on your location and destination, buses are actually faster.
Mean while in places like Tokyo the trains are far more efficient because way more people take the train due to just how much faster they are than any other method. I never took a bus once when I was in Tokyo.
Also here's another thing, most of the profits of rail operators in Japan make their profit by owning and developing the land around the stations. This at almost every train station, you have so many shops and business.
New York city is a single city. Why doesn't it have something equivalent?
Because the government won't fund something that helps the economy in general because that's seen as communism.
Welcome to Singapore.
However, it isn't by choice. Our government made it extremely expensive to own and drive cars in order to limit the number of car ownership on my tiny island state (although that is basically taking the easy way out). So they had to make public bus and train system have some standards and uphold it there. If they don't, over two-third of the civilian population will put the ruling party out of power in an instant.
So yea, it isn't by choice.
That being said, the Singapore government does do some stuff that prioritises car drivers over other forms of transport, and the time scaling for transportation hugely favours cars once you need to go from one side of the island to the other for your daily commute (something a good number of Singaporeans have to do).
And the immense cost of cars in Singapore definitely don't help with the quality of drivers here. The piece of paper that you need to have before you can even think about buying a car here is called the Certificate of Entitlement, and the jokes write themselves from here on.
As someone who lives in one of the few states that has a halfway decent public transportation system (NJ), I concur. It’s cool to be able to hop on a train and be in most places in New Jersey, and also NYC within a few hours.
""Within a few hours""
Bby NJ is tiny how is it taking them a few hours to go somewhere inside it.
We decided to put stations every 2 miles on a 50 mile run
It's not all that tiny. It takes almost 4 hours to drive from the top to the bottom of it.
I mean it’s good but it’s still nowhere near other countries tbh
Yep. Not European, but hopping in one of my country's air conditioned electric buses with multiple USB charging ports makes me feel like a king. Specially when it is 35°C outside. Confortable buses plus reliable metro makes for an excellent experience with public transportation in my country (Chile). Looking back 20 years ago... Wow, we've come far.
Chile seems pretty cool, NGL. Never met a Chilean who wasn't a pretty fun and humble person.
Sadly we've been getting pretty xenophobic as a country against other latinoamericans. It's baffling. There was a big wave of Venezuelan immigration in the last 7 years or so, and the media is parroting about every old stereotype: ""They took er jerbs"" (Jobs you didn't want), ""They send criminals"" (less criminality than the average chilean), ""They are saturating the public health system"" (that was covid). Sure, there has been an increase in murder rate. Most of which are criminals vs criminals. But the overall crime rate is 33% below what it was 10 years ago, yet the ""sensation of crime"" or whatever you call it in english is polling at levels similar to countries with failed governments. It's insane.
Other than that, pretty cool country tho. Lots to complain about, but even more to be thankful about. And great landscapes.
Hijacking this comment to complain about USB charging ports. What happened to power sockets? USB charging is absolutely not safe. Anyone could temper with that and infiltrate your phone. Went for a intercontinental flight the other day and could not charge my phone anywhere, cause everything is just USB charging spots...
Power sockets are 220v. Much more dangerous in terms of electrocution.
Until you start setting fire to the subway because price increases
No fueron 30 pesos...
And look, the unrest happened, and we still have top notch public transportation. Sure, it was a setback, but it's still amazing.
I wonder if more public transportation would help the sense of community. Cars can be isolating.
I usually commute by public transportation. It just makes me hate people because there are soo many that just don’t know how to behave. Last week there was a dude that just loudly farted and watched TikToks on his phone at a high volume.
I was in Europe for 2 weeks and besides the food, the public transport was my favorite part.
I promise the way to convince anyone how great public transit could be is to take them to a major city in Korea or Japan. Now pick any hotel or wherever they happened to 'appear' and ask them where they want to eat or what tourist thing they want to see. No matter where they are or where they want to be there is a subway station within a short walk and you don't have to check times. Just go find it, the next train will be arriving within 5 minutes
But-buh- it is SOCIALISM. You damn COMMIES ruining your country's economy to give to the UNFORTUNATE?!? Why don't they just pull themselves up by their bootstraps? If they can't do that they're lazy and not worth saving.
Even shit tier public transportation is decent. You don't have to watch the road, you can literally take a nap, no road rage, no monthly car payment, never need to worry about crap like getting tires rotated, oil changes, insurance premiums going up, someone breaking into your car....
Yeah, but what about some crazy person rigging a bomb to explode if your bus drops below a certain speed?
No it's not. Take a Greyhound anywhere in the country and it will take twice as long as driving.
Airline lobbyists killed any chances of high speed trains a long time ago.
“But Europe is so tiny, we can’t possibly build something like that, it wouldn’t work here. They have a homogenous population (they use this anytime they wanna say something can’t be done and are racist)”
“But don’t look at China, they are communist” 🙄
Also, good chance that picture was taken around the time Hurricane Sandy hit NYC (and shut the city down).
NYC has some beautiful subway stops too: https://secretnyc.co/beautiful-subway-stations-in-nyc/
Exactly, Hudson Yards looks incredible. Not exactly a surprise that the century old stations may look a bit decrepit in a hurricane situation.
Ahh yes the ones that famously removed all seating so they won't have homeless people loitering.

lmao, been here 7 years, have seen something like this exactly once and it was in red hook.
Wonder if you’re from upstate or the south, since you’ve clearly never been anywhere but times square in NYC.
At which stations? I never saw anything like that when I lived there after Sandy, and I lived on the R line that got taken out by Sandy.
Yes, specifically hurricane severe, which is a pretty rare event.
The Fulton center one even looks like the one in China above.
no, this has happened many times since Sandy in lesser (but still torrential) rains, I’d say at least once a year. I believe most recently in Sept 2023 (tropical storm Ophelia, which also shut the subway system down)
I think the picture was from a major rainstorm we had in 2022.
The chances that this meme's creator would ever voluntarily set foot in any subway, in any country, are essentially zero.
Chinese Metros are clean AF
Ok? DC metro is pretty clean too. But cleanliness isn't the issue here.
Yeah, and I actually believe it. If there is real threat to your body due to littering, people will fucking learn.
Yeah, you can have clean subways when your homeess people magically disappear
The chances that this meme's creator would ever voluntarily set foot in any subway, in any country, are essentially zero.
There is entirely a very good chance that this meme was created or shared in order to help in Russian propaganda. Tucker Cucker did the same thing last week with his Russian report. So now the propaganda will be 'US is a shit hole, look how nice X place is'.
Of course they won't go after the things that actually suck like our healthcare system.
That's a good point. I probably should have said ""...whoever shared this meme ...""
Also, pretty sure the NY Subway is almost 100 years older than that Chinese one.
True, but they really do get maintained well. I think they close the trains each night for a number of hours so the tracks and trains themselves can be worked on.
Meh, literally every tourist I’ve met in the city raves about NYC having 24 hour subways.
We’re the financial capital of the world, with a 100 year old metro system and open 24/7. Not trying to win a clean off.
And we still won't take care of ours.
I just looked it up. The NY subway was first opened in 1904.
And the Guangzhou Metro is from 1997. And per Wikipedia most of their stations are under construction right now.

I don't get it in the Netherlands they got homes and train stations legit older than the us that work without problems
But ""the leaders of the new world"" cant even build a working train station
Let us not forget the very generous rebates, tax breaks and subsidies afforded the new EV market, enabling upper income Americans to finally be able to buy new cars. This money could have been spent on developing high speed rail but there is not as much graft there.
We obviously need both. You cannot turn from a car centric transport into a rail centric one overnight, and EV vehicles save lives by reducing pollution.
It's less about some EV subsidies and more about the cost to maintain the sprawling road system and other infrastructure in low density areas.
The US has the money for transportation but it just goes to roads and highways instead of trains.
The unfortunate thing about the low density car based the suburban neighborhoods that country has subsidized most of the last century is that they have low economics of scale for the physical infrastructure.
Think about a suburban street in a neighborhood of only single family homes. Let's say this street is long enough to have 20 homes on it. That's 20 residents/families to draw money from to maintain not just the road but also the water system, the sewage system, the power grid, and any other modern utilities. Usually their taxes/payments to utility services don't cover the cost of the infrastructure and funds from other revenue sources, from state or federal grants, or debt makes up the difference.
Now think about a similar length street in a city. That street might have 100s of homes full of people living off of it paying taxes that can go towards maintaining the infrastructure. In a dense enough cities we might be talking about 1000s of people.
The infrastructure of the US hasn’t been maintained for decades. Sending Ukraine was never the issue.



We just passed a huge bill a few years ago for infrastructure, though it takes time to get it all finished.
Almost none of it was for public transit infrastructure though, which is the original topic. The US will never build proper public transit, even if we stop all aid everywhere
Check the profile, clearly it's one of many russian propaganda accounts. They are intentionally mixing unrelated issues and playing on people's fears and frustrations. Fear mongering about domestic/social issues, but always find a way to frame aid to Ukraine as the root of all issues to make it unpopular
Also, one should aspire to be better. If someone has it nicer, don't scoff at it like OP's title. Make it happen for yourself.
Nyc has gross subways but they do what they need to. Never really had a problem. They’re like 3 minutes late sometimes that’s it.
It would be cool to have more Amtrak lines and stations, but the line that goes up and down the east coast works well, except that it isn’t that fast.
NY system is better than a pathetic start. Compared to other systems though, it's still gross, and I don't mean the smell. We could do so much more in the US. More stations, more trains, more speed (especially over long distance), and more effort is what we need.
I agree. It would be great to have more high speed rails going across country, and cleaner subways. But I do think american cities are very spaced out, and there’s just such vast distances we need to cover, that driving/flying work out. In europe everything is so compact and close that trains make a lot more sense.
A lot of room for improvement though, especially when you consider environmental concerns
You also need to not let them turn gross and people need to learn decorum
The new York system is one of the largest in the world
1st by number of stations, first for number of lines, 13th in length (3km shorter than the London underground), 10th by annual ridership.
If what new York has so much more to go than no system in the world is good.
Yeah, and they’re literally 100 years older than the Chinese ones.
What do you think public transport runs on?
Electricity. Ideally this would be produced with renewable energy, and currently, the majority of it is. I don't mean to judge your intentions, but is this you seeking to double down on how aggressive oil companies want to halt any and all progression of mass transit?

Gentleman by the name of Colin Ferguson (not the actor, unfortunate coincidence of the same name) in New York in 1993 comes to mind.
The visual here is fascinating and disgusting at the same time. So thank you and fuck you.
To be perfectly honest, I think it's the only reason it's gotten so much attention. People love a spectacle.
So American infrastructure is absolute shit because of the oil industry… I get this feeling all those patchouli candles gave you brain damage 😂

Ahh this has been an issue way before Ukraine lol. Some of our politicians are way way against investing in our infrastructure. Just look at our dams. Most of the dams in our country is over 50 years old and in danger of collapsing. Inspection of them are supposed to be at least annually but many don’t. Because there isn’t enough personnel for it.
We all look at China and think crappy made things but we all forget that WE exploited them and paid them to make quality f things. We paid for quality f things, they will made quality f things. And since then we have established that we accept quality for things so they keep shipping quality f things to us. Like how China is now too expensive so now we went on to exploit India and Indonesia (why many things are made there now)
Unironically, yes. One doesn't even need to cut off funding. Just take 1 percent of the fucking military budget and you'll have a decent start",2024-02-20T10:06:17.834Z,AngrySmapdi,15.4

You most definetly have not been to Hungary. Our trains are late by a collective time of 4 years each year.
i have been to hungary. great food, shitty politics

Glad to see improvement.
I visited Hungary once via train from Hessen, Germany. I was young and a cigarette smoker. As the train rolled in to the station in Budapest, I was anxious for a smoke (hours without). I looked up to see no smoking signs through the train windows. Big sad. Once the doors opened, I saw a taxi driver and a bag helper on the indoor platform. The no smoking sign was visible just over their shoulders. They both had lit cigarettes in their mouths. I lit up as soon as they had my bags in hand. In that moment, I knew I was going to love Hungary!
I went to China for my first time a couple months ago and their public transportation left quite an impression on me. Coming back to the U.S. felt like there was a giant hole missing.
Bullet trains seem like something that would be extremely convenient
Yeah having been to both the USA and China, I have to say China's trains are some of the best I've ever been on, both metro and HSR. I haven't been to Japan to compare but it's at least as good as what I've used in Europe.

Have you used trams in urban settings?
They are a marvel - we have a few that are used hundred thousand times daily. I can't fathom how much space the same amount of trips would take in cars
I can't fathom how much space the same amount of trips would take in cars
Not only is that reducing the number of cars on the road, it's giving people who shouldn't be driving a reason not to. If there were more bus routes near bars that could take people home, we'd likely have far fewer DUIs here in the states.
I'm a fan of the Singaporean train and tram system too. They got that rocking with convenience and affordability.
It probably helps when your entire country is a single city.
It's similar to Tokyo though. And Tokyo itself is way bigger than Singapore in its entirety.
Nah man, as a Singaporean, the train system here isn't as efficient as other countries because we are too small. In fact if you know how to navigate the bus system here, depending on your location and destination, buses are actually faster.
Mean while in places like Tokyo the trains are far more efficient because way more people take the train due to just how much faster they are than any other method. I never took a bus once when I was in Tokyo.
Also here's another thing, most of the profits of rail operators in Japan make their profit by owning and developing the land around the stations. This at almost every train station, you have so many shops and business.
New York city is a single city. Why doesn't it have something equivalent?
Because the government won't fund something that helps the economy in general because that's seen as communism.
Welcome to Singapore.
However, it isn't by choice. Our government made it extremely expensive to own and drive cars in order to limit the number of car ownership on my tiny island state (although that is basically taking the easy way out). So they had to make public bus and train system have some standards and uphold it there. If they don't, over two-third of the civilian population will put the ruling party out of power in an instant.
So yea, it isn't by choice.
That being said, the Singapore government does do some stuff that prioritises car drivers over other forms of transport, and the time scaling for transportation hugely favours cars once you need to go from one side of the island to the other for your daily commute (something a good number of Singaporeans have to do).
And the immense cost of cars in Singapore definitely don't help with the quality of drivers here. The piece of paper that you need to have before you can even think about buying a car here is called the Certificate of Entitlement, and the jokes write themselves from here on.
As someone who lives in one of the few states that has a halfway decent public transportation system (NJ), I concur. It’s cool to be able to hop on a train and be in most places in New Jersey, and also NYC within a few hours.
""Within a few hours""
Bby NJ is tiny how is it taking them a few hours to go somewhere inside it.
We decided to put stations every 2 miles on a 50 mile run
It's not all that tiny. It takes almost 4 hours to drive from the top to the bottom of it.
I mean it’s good but it’s still nowhere near other countries tbh
Yep. Not European, but hopping in one of my country's air conditioned electric buses with multiple USB charging ports makes me feel like a king. Specially when it is 35°C outside. Confortable buses plus reliable metro makes for an excellent experience with public transportation in my country (Chile). Looking back 20 years ago... Wow, we've come far.
Chile seems pretty cool, NGL. Never met a Chilean who wasn't a pretty fun and humble person.
Sadly we've been getting pretty xenophobic as a country against other latinoamericans. It's baffling. There was a big wave of Venezuelan immigration in the last 7 years or so, and the media is parroting about every old stereotype: ""They took er jerbs"" (Jobs you didn't want), ""They send criminals"" (less criminality than the average chilean), ""They are saturating the public health system"" (that was covid). Sure, there has been an increase in murder rate. Most of which are criminals vs criminals. But the overall crime rate is 33% below what it was 10 years ago, yet the ""sensation of crime"" or whatever you call it in english is polling at levels similar to countries with failed governments. It's insane.
Other than that, pretty cool country tho. Lots to complain about, but even more to be thankful about. And great landscapes.
Hijacking this comment to complain about USB charging ports. What happened to power sockets? USB charging is absolutely not safe. Anyone could temper with that and infiltrate your phone. Went for a intercontinental flight the other day and could not charge my phone anywhere, cause everything is just USB charging spots...
Power sockets are 220v. Much more dangerous in terms of electrocution.
Until you start setting fire to the subway because price increases
No fueron 30 pesos...
And look, the unrest happened, and we still have top notch public transportation. Sure, it was a setback, but it's still amazing.
I wonder if more public transportation would help the sense of community. Cars can be isolating.
I usually commute by public transportation. It just makes me hate people because there are soo many that just don’t know how to behave. Last week there was a dude that just loudly farted and watched TikToks on his phone at a high volume.
I was in Europe for 2 weeks and besides the food, the public transport was my favorite part.
I promise the way to convince anyone how great public transit could be is to take them to a major city in Korea or Japan. Now pick any hotel or wherever they happened to 'appear' and ask them where they want to eat or what tourist thing they want to see. No matter where they are or where they want to be there is a subway station within a short walk and you don't have to check times. Just go find it, the next train will be arriving within 5 minutes
But-buh- it is SOCIALISM. You damn COMMIES ruining your country's economy to give to the UNFORTUNATE?!? Why don't they just pull themselves up by their bootstraps? If they can't do that they're lazy and not worth saving.
Even shit tier public transportation is decent. You don't have to watch the road, you can literally take a nap, no road rage, no monthly car payment, never need to worry about crap like getting tires rotated, oil changes, insurance premiums going up, someone breaking into your car....
Yeah, but what about some crazy person rigging a bomb to explode if your bus drops below a certain speed?
No it's not. Take a Greyhound anywhere in the country and it will take twice as long as driving.
Airline lobbyists killed any chances of high speed trains a long time ago.
“But Europe is so tiny, we can’t possibly build something like that, it wouldn’t work here. They have a homogenous population (they use this anytime they wanna say something can’t be done and are racist)”
“But don’t look at China, they are communist” 🙄",2024-02-20T12:01:21.048Z,Azipear,15.4.1
,"Or being in London and experience their every 1-2 minute train. Our dumb asses ran to catch the train and one member of my group got on and the rest didn’t. Then we look up and see the next train is in 1 minute. My city trains are 20-60 minutes apart lol
Yeah, brits like to moan about their trains but they’re still on another level to the US. Having a huge country should mean a robust rail network, not a non-existent one!
Come to anywhere in England that isn't London and 20 minutes between trains seems like a luxury.
I'm in the North and there's 3 trains per hour between 2 major cities. Are they 20 mintues apart from eachother? No. They are all between 40 and 50 minutes past the hour. So if you show up at 51 minutes past the hour, you've got to wait 50 minutes for the next train.
If you show up at 40 minutes past the hour, there's 3 trains within the next 10 mintues.
Fuck the UK's shitty rail transport that is crap (and overpriced at around £1 every minute travelled) everywhere outside of London.
The great transport in London is at the expense the rest of the UK.
Check the history of UK rail, it's an interesting read. It was basically a collection of bankrupt railways that got bought up and stitched together.
Londoner here. We complain when the next train is more than 3 mins away.
New York is not far off from that. Trains every 3-5 mins usually
I was in London in October I was impressed by the public transportation system
Not sure it’s fair comparing a 1,000 year old capital city to your podunk town though. The DC metro, small compared to NYC, runs trains about every 6 minutes in rush hour (pre-pandemic), tough to do more than that because the train has to pull in, offload, unload, then clear out before the next train arrives.
The photo above is comparing a NYC subway during an emergency (likely a hurricane in progress) to a newly built showcase station that will likely fall to shit in 5 years because of cheap materials and lack of maintenance. It’s 100% a Russian disinformation campaign.
Ahh. I live in Boston. Literally consider one of the most publicly accessible city in the USA lol. Our subway has no real schedule they come when they come. They mostly range 20-60 minutes apart and then suddenly there is one 5 minutes apart lol.
This sounds like the red line in Boston.

Yeah like for what it's worth, the public transit near my house right outside of a big American city is halfway decent, it takes me exactly where I need to go quickly.

,"Let us not forget the very generous rebates, tax breaks and subsidies afforded the new EV market, enabling upper income Americans to finally be able to buy new cars. This money could have been spent on developing high speed rail but there is not as much graft there.
We obviously need both. You cannot turn from a car centric transport into a rail centric one overnight, and EV vehicles save lives by reducing pollution.
It's less about some EV subsidies and more about the cost to maintain the sprawling road system and other infrastructure in low density areas.
The US has the money for transportation but it just goes to roads and highways instead of trains.
The unfortunate thing about the low density car based the suburban neighborhoods that country has subsidized most of the last century is that they have low economics of scale for the physical infrastructure.
Think about a suburban street in a neighborhood of only single family homes. Let's say this street is long enough to have 20 homes on it. That's 20 residents/families to draw money from to maintain not just the road but also the water system, the sewage system, the power grid, and any other modern utilities. Usually their taxes/payments to utility services don't cover the cost of the infrastructure and funds from other revenue sources, from state or federal grants, or debt makes up the difference.
Now think about a similar length street in a city. That street might have 100s of homes full of people living off of it paying taxes that can go towards maintaining the infrastructure. In a dense enough cities we might be talking about 1000s of people.",2024-02-20T13:15:00.472Z,Chuckleyan,15.4.6

Flawed would be the proper terminology. The states aren't so united after all.
FWIW: the US has a decently well-thought out building code that's mandatory for all new builds. China does as well, but builders tend to have real problems meeting the grade.
This is true for buildings, some in less central areas can have real problems - but in general, transport infrastructure in China does not suffer from these problems and is instead world-class.
Transport in China is a propaganda tool, essentially. They invest heavily to connect even remote areas to the road and rail network, and build huge high speed capacity all over - Western observers often crow that it'll never make it's money back, but that isn't at all the point.
These are done to ensure the population feels connected and sees the benefit in having a centralized government that can invest in long-term projects without worrying about losing elections etc - ie, it is to convince the population that the CCP are helping them, making their lives better, and superior to the alternative that a Western-style democracy would bring.
propaganda by genuinely providing at better system?
Isn’t subsidizing remote and less developed area and not worrying about profit supposed to be what a functioning government does? Am I missing something here?
And a severe problem that we have is expecting our government services to make money or pay for themselves...like the issues with the Post Office or Amtrak.... its a service - it doesn't have to make money... not everything has to generate profit.
I really wish the U.S has such a propaganda tool as well

public transit, china: propaganda 🤢
Yes, but it really does help bring prosperity to people. Infrastructure construction created massive numbers of jobs, both for educated and uneducated people. Plus, large parts of China (for example in Guizhou) were isolated even 20 years ago because mountain roads were impassable during winter. Goods couldn't come in, people needing medical care couldn't go out. With the building of high-speed rail and highway tunnels, people can get where they need to go. I was on vacation and one lady told me it used to take 10 hours to get from her village to the nearest city because of the mountains and bad roads. Now she can get on a train and it's an hour and a half.
Propaganda that the government is helping them by giving people services that help the people?
Very true. Russia (or more accurately Moscow) also has stunning subway stations. Somewhat coincidental no? Let's also think of how people who cause damage (not serious but things like grafitti, littering, urination) to any of these stations are treated in China / Russia vs. USA. Would we all like it if American infrastructure was more extensive and nicer? Of course. Do you want your stupid teenager or drunk spouse getting sent to a penal colony for 20 because they pissed in a corner? Probably not
Also it's basically an ad for other countries. China builds insane amounts of infrastructure for smaller countries and gets them indebted to China
It's more fucked up than that.
Back in the 1990s (I think, might be a bit earlier), there was a bill at the Federal level to commit funds to upgrade the subway system. The bill would match state funds that NY set aside for the project, the idea being that the subway system is critical from a national security standpoint.
ONE SENATOR from Alabama filibustered the bill, killing it. A senator representing a state that has nothing to do with the subway in any way, shape, or form. He did it because NY is (in his mind) nothing but Jews, Blacks, and Liberals, and he had a chance to fuck them under.
It's also because of residual resentment for losing the Civil War.
They got angry when the interstate highway was being built because it wasn’t privatized.
Love the way the pictures cherry pick the facts that they wanted to show.
Yep. Just two years ago there were a bunch of videos of people in a flooded subway in China.
It’s always the same false dichotomy. Either you upgrade public transport or you support Ukraine, either you send aid to Syria or you support veterans, bla bla bla. Oddly enough it seems always be about “furreners” as well…
China has newer transportation infrastructure with more modern designs, and the reason we don't is because America helped people I don't like. That's the ticket.
Literally:
Rupert murdoch: Careful mate, that foreigner wants your cookie!
My family is from guangzhou so we would go visit every few years since I was a kid. I havent gone since 2015 though. The difference in how clean and new everything was from my visit in early 2000s and 2012 and 2015 was huge... there used to be no direct flights to guangzhou from my city, only to hong kong. It took 2.5+ hrs by train, in 2012 it took like 40 minutes. It used to take forever if we took the bus anywhere, but omg the trains are so fast! The predictions are correct and they had these doors on the platforms from keeping people jumping/falling. Im not saying China doesn't have problems(they sure do). But trains aint one of them.... Also, their roads arent riddled with potholes like how it is in my area.
China has newer as they didn’t have it before. The Guangzhou subway opened in 1997. The New York subway opened in 1904.
For those not a fan of maths, that is 93 years earlier.
Yep that's why they have term ""tofu buildings"". Look China is big, and has lot of underdeveloped places but they were smart and used corporate greed at maximum. Take 2 watches, one is ""Made in China"" other ""Swiss made"" same price, your choice is? They had great potential to surpass US but did some cardinal mistakes. Also communists are usually not flexible but can be very patient.
If they're the same price, the ""made in China bad"" argument falls apart. Chinese goods are only bad because Western companies take advantage of their cheap labor to cut costs at the expense of product quality. They're just as capable of producing high-quality goods as anyone else when they have the motivation to do so.

It’s not just the republicans I’m sorry to tell you. It’s everybody. I wish it was as simple as the baddies love oil.
Yup, both of them, sure. Hey, which side was the one that voted against taking money out of politics again?
I'll give you a hint: it wasn't both my friend.

It’s also not because China has an authoritarian government that can ram through mega projects, take needed land and provide slave labor for it.
Look at the high speed rail projects in Texas and California and all we have to do to get the needed tracks from landowners.
And it's surely not because China is a dictatorship and your property means nothing to them. They can build if they want and when they want.
Not true. A lot of Chinese in the past 20 years yearn for the government to take over their land because they gain new property and cash in exchange for their land (拆迁). Many have become millionaires as a result.",2024-02-20T09:55:32.352Z,LordTinglewood,15.5

,"I remember a time when ""right wingers"" used to hate communism...
China and Russia are only communists on paper though. They are autocratic capitalists, two things republicans love above anything else.
Russia isn't communist on paper, it hasn't been in 32 years and the capitalism started creeping in a bit before that.
Hate to break it to ya honey, but capitalism is inherently autocratic. Democracy and capitalism are incompatible on many levels.
I think the point is right wingers claiming money sent abroad could benefit people at home are disingenuous because they don't want public spending either.
To be fair, Democrats don't want to spend money on infrastructure either, but they get a pass from liberals because of the ""lesser of two evils"" argument. American politics are pointless. Corps win, regardless. But hey, as long as we keep fighting over the same God damn three issues (abortion, guns, and who does or doesn't have a penis) we'll never get nice things... Or like, healthcare.
To be fair, Democrats don't want to spend money on infrastructure either
Well that's a lie. Every Democrat in the oval office since FDR has made infrastructure a priority.
What about the huge infrastructure bill passed in Biden’s first year? What about the huge infrastructure bill that Obama passed? What about republicans taking credit for infrastructure in their districts even though they voted against the bills that funded it?
Still, China is still nominally communist. Repubelickans and Musk tries to ignore that fact.
A communist country with the 2nd higher number of billionaire in the world. A joke

china's government is absolutely communist ideologically, they dont claim to ave achieved their end goals yet. you have no idea what communism is or how its supposed to be achieved because you have never read the relevant books.
A common misconception.
China is most assuredly a Marxist Leninist government.
Just because they have a strong veneer of capitalism, don’t mistake them for capitalists. From their form of government down to how they manage their economy, they (especially Xi) take a Marxist Leninist approach to it.
Russia’s just a clusterfuck of oligarchs and serfs…
My baptist highschool used to talk all the time about the evils of ""Papers please!"" and the Berlin wall.
These days they'd be the type of people to check the papers of any brown skinned people, and want the""unclimbable"" border wall.
Turns out taxes and income equality is a bigger enemy to these people than the KGB (FSB) and CCP.
My dad is a tattooist and he once had a client who told him that we should have tighter security on the Mexican border and he said “Why not on the Canadian border?” And she said “Well that’s different because they look like us”
The pandemic and twisted media have warped a lot of minds...
Communism isn’t the enemy anymore. It’s woke-ism. Sure Russia and China are ruled by dictators who will arrest and kill anyone for speaking against the government, but look how nice their subways and grocery stores are.
Yes, proudly pronouncing ""DoNt TrEaD oN mE"" while literally begging for a police surveillance state with a supreme dictator...
Granted china is only communist in name
God at least then it made sense. At least there was an actual, verbalized concern. Here it's just like a person with ADHD, who is in denial. Whatever moves is a problem, doesn't matter if they supported it or hated it 5 minutes ago. It's like instead of taking Adderall, they just got super high, and are now dealing with ADHD paranoia.
Indeed. So, if they can do great capitalist business with China, and China can do so well doing capitalism, it might be time to look beyond that country's branding and ask whether it is actually ""communist"" in any common sense use of the term.",2024-02-20T11:17:11.225Z,Unhappy_Surround_982,15.7
,"China and Russia are only communists on paper though. They are autocratic capitalists, two things republicans love above anything else.
Russia isn't communist on paper, it hasn't been in 32 years and the capitalism started creeping in a bit before that.
Hate to break it to ya honey, but capitalism is inherently autocratic. Democracy and capitalism are incompatible on many levels.
I think the point is right wingers claiming money sent abroad could benefit people at home are disingenuous because they don't want public spending either.
To be fair, Democrats don't want to spend money on infrastructure either, but they get a pass from liberals because of the ""lesser of two evils"" argument. American politics are pointless. Corps win, regardless. But hey, as long as we keep fighting over the same God damn three issues (abortion, guns, and who does or doesn't have a penis) we'll never get nice things... Or like, healthcare.
To be fair, Democrats don't want to spend money on infrastructure either
Well that's a lie. Every Democrat in the oval office since FDR has made infrastructure a priority.
What about the huge infrastructure bill passed in Biden’s first year? What about the huge infrastructure bill that Obama passed? What about republicans taking credit for infrastructure in their districts even though they voted against the bills that funded it?
Still, China is still nominally communist. Repubelickans and Musk tries to ignore that fact.
A communist country with the 2nd higher number of billionaire in the world. A joke

china's government is absolutely communist ideologically, they dont claim to ave achieved their end goals yet. you have no idea what communism is or how its supposed to be achieved because you have never read the relevant books.
A common misconception.
China is most assuredly a Marxist Leninist government.
Just because they have a strong veneer of capitalism, don’t mistake them for capitalists. From their form of government down to how they manage their economy, they (especially Xi) take a Marxist Leninist approach to it.

,"Ah yes, two out of context videos. Perfect comparisons.
The subway in New York looks it got flooded by a storm or something, and the one in China looks like someone is videoing it because it looks cool.
The same people also advocate for defunding public transportation and healthcare for legal American citizens. In fact, illegal immigrants don't have federally-supported healthcare at all (mostly through philanthropy instead, and we all know how ""equally"" people have access to those).
exactly, I have been to Beijing and used the metro....trust me, it doesn't look like that. Not all together horrible, but it is brand new.....and the party does not allow debate on how money is spent. My Chinese colleagues told me anecdotally that you can be filthy rich there and if the party wants your business, you comply or disappear.
And in the US the corporation pays off the government and does whatever they want….Gotta find a good middle ground somewhere
To be fair I feel like Public transportation is more necessary for the homeless population rather than people who are economically stable (whether they are old or not) especially since the public transport in my city sucks ASS! I called them and they told that with the way the routes intersect it would take me 2 hours of public transportation to cover a 14 minute Uber ride. I could literally walk that distance faster than the public transportation could get me across what should be basically a straight shot to that exact location.
That's the way it is in the US. Try the system in NYC or Chicago (the best ones in America rn), and they're at best 30% as good as Singapore/Japan/Taiwan/Most Western European countries. In those places (incl NYC to a certain extent), people use pub trans almost regardless of social class.


The problem is public transportation usually has to cross jurisdictions. Without national help, it's guaranteed to be a mess.
The image of the NYC subway is painting it in a bad light here. It's old but very functional and well done. But it only exists within NYC. Most other states have nothing. And if NY wants to connect rail systems to other states, NY can't be the one funding everything.
Wow you mean the blue states that are not in federal debt unlike the red states..

And hilariously, everyone seems to have forgotten the 2021 subway flooding in Zhengzhou where at least 14 died. We don't really know if there were more due to censorship.

You should do it, most people don't know what the Moynihan Train Hall is. I myself haven't even been in it. Still slumming it in good ole Penn Station.
You'd be surprised, the worst station I've seen was Shenzhen, because it was built decades ago. All the stations dedicated to high speed rails are newly built and look like the picture.
It's also one subway station out of many. I lived in Beijing for almost two years and I've been to a lot of different subway stations. Most don't look like this. Though I will say, even the oldest and plainer stations are big, effective public transit hubs. But, you don't have to go far from a subway station to find crumbling buildings and walls that were built like shit with inferior materials.
Yeah, that looks like it was taken during Sandy. Way out of context.

,"Just stop with the Ukrainian scapegoat already.
Let’s be real, if the war in Ukraine wasn’t happening. Money still wouldn’t be going towards improving infrastructure and livelihoods.
What was being done to improve this in the 2000s? The 2010s? And right up to Feb 2022? Nothing. So don’t act like helping Ukraine is some sort of magical barrier now all of a sudden stopping you from improving things in the US.
The vast majority of the Ukraine money never leaves the US. It just goes to pay to the US Weapons makers.
The dirty open secret being that the US needs there to be conflicts around the world because their national defense is strengthed by private arms manufacturing. Ukraine is pretty much a best case scenario: A ""just"" war they don't have to directly participate in that weakens one of their top imperial adversaries and funds the military industrial complex.
The vast majority of Ukraine money was spent ten years ago, and we're just shipping the results out now.
When did helping Ukraine with their war effort against Russia become synonymous with helping Israel with their efforts against Hamas?
Like, those are two vastly different scenarios....
They are linked in that they’re conflicts instigated by two allied powers Russia and Iran respectively. Which is interesting in itself imo in how it changes how the US’s position in geopolitics is viewed (not that nobody was aware of the generally dubious acts by the US abroad. But the pretense that we’re “spreading freedom and democracy” is undermined by supporting Israel. This undermines support for intervention by the US both home and abroad. How this relates to them being allies is that it benefits Russia bc in that Ukraine gets less support)
To most people though they’re linked in that they’re military conflicts abroad that people feel detached from. As such, they find it strange to be “sending money” to them when people are struggling domestically.
It's nuts people are actually discussing China vs New York.
This is OBVIOUSLY Russian output. If you were at war and your opponent was being funded by someone else, wouldn't you try to reduce that funding by manipulating that third party?
Very true! Anyway is the Ukraine support really free? Wouldn't US profit of this later with better prices of commodities from UA or US companies get benefits in competition?
Ukraine support isn't totally free, but it's a lot less expensive than the numbers being reported. That's because the reported numbers are the value of the materiel we're getting to them. But a lot of that materiel is old and outdated -- basically military surplus. If we didn't ship it to Ukraine, we'd be paying to either store it or destroy it.
What we're not doing is just handing over wads of cash.

,"The rest of China doesn't make our mass transit system suck any less.
what do you mean? many cities in China have their own metro lines and all of them are pretty modern. Some might not be as modern as other countries but its more than enough for commuting standards
I believe what he was referring to was Op's comment ""Show me the rest of China"" as if the decrepit state of the rest of the country would condone our own decrepit infrastructure.
Also china had more than 35 thousand kilometers long highspeed railway system which is the longest in the world while the united States has none
The issue is *why it sucks, which is decades of interference from conservatives who defund infrastructure, lower the taxes that fund it, and do nothing to alleviate the stigma of using public transit outside of large cities.
Nobody who wants to see public transit succeed in this country would post this comparison, because everything about it is dishonest.
5th tier Chinese cities still have better transit than basically anywhere in the US besides maybe New York lol

I lived in China for a few years, and trust me it's not the dictatorship, no freedom, everyone lives by a manual and the governments every fart type of life that you're imagining. Most people just work, party, and obsess over celebrities.
China is a dictatorship but America isn’t really a democracy and also when it comes to public transit most countries do a very good job. It’s depressing America is one of the worst if not the most worse in this and I blame private sector for making it awful on purpose.
The fuck. I live in mainland China. The hell you think goes on over here?

bro have you seen people posting the eiffel tower comparing it to a building that was struck by an earthquake in taiwan(the poster thought its in China) calling it slow engineering better than fast building which China is known for. This is like that but reverse.
Also the Eiffel tower is made entirely of wrought iron. While that still might take less time to do these days than it did back then (though I really don't know) it would still take way longer than building not entirely out of wrought iron wtf. 🤦🤦
Technically it is in China. Just the Republic of.
Us public transit is still worse than China’s though, and it’s worse than pretty much every other developed country.
Yea because evey country's infrastructure was Eviscerated during WW2. Easier to build from scratch.
I was in NYC last september, and whole lines were blocked and flooded because... it was raining for a few days. I saw water dripping from above as I was inside the subway. So the issue is clearly not a storm or some extreme scenario. And that's coming from someone who absolutely loves NYC but come on stop the bad faith
Tbf the nyc subway is actually nicer when flooded lmao
It’s much more recent than Sandy, but your point still stands.
It’s cherry-picking at its finest. There are some beautiful stations / bus stops / metro whatever the fuck you want to call it in the US too. Likewise, there are some really shady hubs in China from my experience, definitely some I’d prefer never to step foot in again.

,"To be fair, the majority of Chinese folk don't mind working hard and selling cheap to achieve something. From what I'm aware the usual builder attitude is to lengthen the amount of time it takes to complete a task artificially so that they stay employed for longer and the government loses more money. Whereas in China, when it comes to public infrastructure, the people generally support the government and don't mind providing cheaper materials at the same quality and working hard to build efficiently. A good example being the COVID era where they had folks build entire hospitals within just over a week.
To the comments claiming that China is a dictatorship, my simple advice is that you go and visit the country at least once in your life. It wouldn't really be fair for me to slander another country if I haven't been there yet. Having been to China a fair few times I can say that the populace is generally happy with their leaders, and if they weren't and they really wanted it, the old saying goes that if every citizen in the country goes to the capital and spits once, the so called 'dictators' would drown.

,"When I was in middle school my parents took my sister and I to China for three weeks. My dad had a buddy who was teaching English there and he made arrangements for us to travel with and visit the hometowns of some of his students. Granted, this was a long time ago now. I’m sure things have changed a lot, but I’m certain some of it has stayed the same also.
We took a week long train trip from Baoding, through Chengdu to Xian and flew back. We took road trips to villages I couldn’t locate on a map. I don’t want to cast Chinese people in a negative light. Most of the people we met were friendly, intelligent, hard working, generous and kind. However, the disparity between the haves and have nots was astounding. People scavenging coal dropped from trucks to heat their homes. Pollution that blocked out the sun so the windows were tinted blue to compensate for the sickly orange color outside. Places where the government had once mandated that trees be removed so that birds wouldn’t eat the crops causing ecological collapse.
Cherry-picking the best and worst examples of things to frame an argument so that the reader is coerced into drawing your conclusion is dangerous. China is not all glitzy hyper-modern urbanized infrastructure. The majority of it is the opposite. It is a much more complicated thing on the inside. It’s a place that made huge strides forward in a very short period, but like all places, the development is somewhat uneven. It’s just compounded by the sheer scale.
If you have the opportunity, you should come visit China again and visit the same places that you visited back then and see the changes for yourself. As a Chinese in my mid-30s, I believe that the development of my country can only truly be appreciated with a perspective of time.

,"The NYTs has 10.36 million subscribers - 9.7 million digital only. Their annual revenue for digital is [One Billion smackaroos] (https://www.nytimes.com/2024/02/07/business/media/new-york-times-q4-earnings.html#:~:text=The%20Times%20reported%20total%20revenue,compared%20with%20a%20year%20earlier.) This is gross, of course. They used to do One Billion in classified ads alone, IIRC. But they found a way to compensate for lack of advertising with their subscriptions.
IIRC, they were early digitizers. They had the means to do so. And they have a product and a market that has been built over decades. In my view no one does Lifestyle, Entertainment, Food sections etc, better; it's their slanted editorial policy with which I have a beef.
Also, they successfully resisted the urge to just put everything online for free, and they had the balls to introduce paywalls back when it seemed like an insane idea.
The were the first to realize that raising an entire generation of audiences to become used to getting everything for free was suicidal long-term, and they acted accordingly.
It wasn’t easy, and they nearly went bankrupt, but they knew that they had to start as early as possible with the new business model, because sooner or later everyone will be doing it.
So here we are now, in 2024, NYT is doing okay, they have re-positioned themselves as a lifestyle brand, they have 10m subscribers, and they have brands like Wirecutter, Cooking, and Puzzles which all help fund their journalism.
And more recently they seem to be pivoting away from social media altogether, which absolutely makes sense.
The rest of the industry is still stuck in 2015, completely addicted to social media as if it’s heroin, and hoping that it will somehow magically bring back the days when industrial-scale spam brought in billions of dollars in venture capital funding.
Those days are simply gone. They are not coming back. Social media no longer needs journalism, they have plundered and sucked everything out of it by now.
And anything you throw into the cesspool of social media today is automatically perceived as spam. You are just adding to the pile of garbage. And it’s only going to get worse with the explosion of AI crap.
Journalism needs audiences willing to pay for journalism. Perhaps these will never be the majority of consumers, but it doesn’t matter - they don’t need to be.
Journalism was never meant to be for everyone, in any era. It’s an expensive business, difficult to operate, difficult to manage, in an industry that’s become incredibly difficult to navigate.
Trying to do journalism today is like trying to start a five-star restaurant in a world in which almost everyone is perfectly happy with just eating hot dogs.",2024-02-18T17:37:46.699Z,Equidae2,16.1

The first thing that comes to mind is the fake joke that Trickle Down economics ever worked, which led to the financial gutting of the American government: the destruction of the Savings and Loan Industries, (small banks that owned 60% of all mortgages in America), the collapse of the the USSR, and finally the GREAT RECESSION of 2008 from which we have never recovered.
Reagan was the Republican version of Trump who in a single lifetime destroyed the very fabric of our economic system, with his fear of Socialism and the Communism. A bad actor, who taught Wall Street to act like a terrorist organization using unregulated Capitalism as a missile of war. who brought down Russia without firing a single shot and destroyed the necessary system of Labor Unions in this country. Reagan is responsible for our current clown car Republican Party, whose only interest is using Wall Street as their own personal ATM.
The Income Inequality that Reagan created is responsible for the Collapse of American Newspapers and a School of Journalism, which at one time, informed the American People of the true Olgarthic nature the American Right.",2024-02-19T13:13:57.086Z,americanspirit64,16.7

,"tldr; Bitcoin and Ethereum have seen a significant surge in value as Wall Street embraces spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs), with predictions of Bitcoin potentially surpassing gold as the world's primary store-of-value. In one week, Bitcoin ETF inflows surpassed $2.4 billion, contributing to a total inflow of over $5.2 billion to crypto funds this year. This has sparked interest in Bitcoin challenging gold's dominance and predictions of Bitcoin reaching $100,000 per unit by 2024. Ethereum is also expected to benefit from spot ETFs, with price predictions reaching up to $10,000 by 2025. The embrace of Bitcoin ETFs by traditional investors reflects growing confidence in the long-term value of these digital assets.

,"The title of the article is ""Musk’s SpaceX Forges Tighter Links With U.S. Spy and Military Agencies"", but most of the content are things we already know, the $1.8B classified contract is the real news. Some additional information from the article:
The Elon Musk-led company entered into a $1.8 billion classified contract with the U.S. government in 2021, according to company documents viewed by The Wall Street Journal. SpaceX said in the documents that funds from the contract were expected to become an important part of its revenue mix in the coming years. It didn’t disclose the name of the government customer.
...
The company has also won significant national-security clients for its satellite technologies—a different set of offerings from SpaceX’s traditional work blasting off satellites for those customers. One such client has been the National Reconnaissance Office, according to people familiar with the matter.
It couldn’t be determined what satellite technology from SpaceX the NRO has tapped.
...
Terrence O’Shaughnessy, who joined SpaceX after retiring in 2020 from the Air Force as a general, has had a high-level role at Starshield, people familiar with the matter said. A biography posted on a trade group’s website described him as a “Senior Advisor to Elon Musk on matters regarding SpaceX” as well as vice president of the company’s Special Programs Group.
He and others have urged the defense establishment to learn from the example set by more agile space startups. Last year, O’Shaughnessy compared how SpaceX developed Starlink with a government effort to create a similar but far smaller fleet. The latter “sounds a lot like Starlink,” he said at a conference. “Yet they’re looking for a couple hundred satellites on orbit.”
 
My guess is the classified contract is for what is now known as StarShield. SpaceX has been hiring people like crazy for StarShield, I wondered before how they can do this without a customer.
O’Shaughnessy, knows his stuff. Here's what he said DoD were looking for: -
“By leveraging a cloud architecture, big data analytics, edge computing, artificial intelligence, and machine learning, this network should sense a threat from one node and engage it precisely and expeditiously from another across vast distances and across all domains.” ~ Terrence J O'Shaughnessy, VP of Special Programs Group at SpaceX and retired USAF 4 Star General
Sure Starshield could help considering it supports all manner of sensors and huge bandwidth for communications, as it uses Starlink to backhaul data.
I, for one, welcome our new orbital overlords
You should remind them that as a trusted journalist, you could be useful in rounding people up to toil in their underground sugar mines :)

,"Most here think Starshield is built on the Starlink satellite chassis - it may even have been plainly confirmed. But that's the current one. I've no doubt SpaceX, General O’Shaughnessy, and Space Force have been working on a larger Starshield sat based on the full sized V.2 Starlink chassis. The development cost and build cost could certainly add up to a lot of money.
The mention of the NRO is interesting. SpaceX has already been under contract (NSSL-2) to launch NRO satellites. The NRO thinks big, they have the biggest spy sats, often launched on the Delta IV Heavy. It's almost inevitable that they've been drawing up preliminary designs for much larger satellites as they've seen Starship becoming more and more likely to succeed. My chief suspect for what 1.8B will buy is a huge custom designed satellite chassis for SIGINT electronic satellites. The current ones have long been rumored to cost over $1B each. SpaceX will be able to make them larger and cheaper.
Once again, I hope the value of Starship to the US's national security needs will see the weight of the DoD and NRO put behind the effort to get environmental clearances pushed through expeditiously. SLC-37 launched a lot of NRO satellites and will apparently be launching more - so it should be put into operation ASAP.
I highly doubt that the NRO would peg SpaceX to build a gigantic spy satellite for a variety of reasons, most importantly that spy satellite capabilities are some of if not the most secretive government-produced technology. Offloading the design to a third party is a huge risk.
SpaceX/Starlink also doesn't specialize in gigantic reconnaissance satellites.
Finally, a large part of how SpaceX is doing things so cheaply is through design innovations, self-funded economies of scale, and in the case of Starlink, operating in a domain that doesn't require full radiation hardening. Outside of design innovations, none of these apply to giant spy satellites and while I wouldn't be shocked if SpaceX could do things cheaper (assuming the NRO is working hand in hand with them on design), it's not going to be like, F9/SS vs Old Space levels of cost differences.
Everything the government does is through a third party, this isn't career civil servants making NRO sats no matter how you slice it. You could easily have the optics and sensors made by traditional third parties, as has always been done, then integrated onto a SpaceX bus as the prime contractor.


Can the spy satellites not work in the same height above the ground that Starlink satellites are working in?
They can, however the design requirements are more stringent. A 5% chance of a Starlink satellite getting fried over its lifetime by cosmic rays, unrecoverable bitflips, or CME isn't a big deal at all. They're small, cheap satellites as part of a huge redundant constellation. That sort of risk for a huge, expensive satellite with little to no redundancies in place is not acceptable so they must be built to much more stringent specifications.
Now, could that philosophy potentially change with the greatly decreased $/kg to orbit that Starship is likely to provide? Sort of, but giant custom-built optics on large satellites are still expensive just from a hardware perspective.
The NRO is most likely working with AST SpaceMobile for a reconnaissance satellite that is designed to capture cellphone signals. Their massive phased arrays are designed specifically to capture low band and midband spectrum. Future versions will also support c-band spectrum and they are highly directional and sensitive. Perfect for signals capturing.
NRO is 100% helping fund putting LTE radios on every Starlink that are compatible with standard cell phones. Now they can easily intercept every cell phone on the planet, oh and T-Mobile can pay some money to serve their customers as well.
Pretty sure they have this capability already, no sats needed. More likely is the need to build out their own constellation on different bands for military use. MilStar is pretty long in the tooth these days.
Remember a year or two ago when they quit showing the satellites deploying and we were deprived of those cool shots? I wonder how that timeframe lines up with this money?
I’m not sure they ever showed deployment of NRO/military satellites.
IMINT satellites are an exquisite optical camera with a satellite bus wrapped around them. SpaceX are not optical manufacturers, they do not have the facilities or experience to even grind the mirrors for a KH-11 sized bird, let alone anything larger. Gaining that capability is beyond non-trivial.
The optical system diameter is the main cost driver. Increasing mirror diameter for a bigger sat will only increase cost, not decrease it.
IMINT satellites have been hitting the Atmospheric Seeing Limit (~4cm) for well over half a century, starting from GAMBIT3 in the mid 1960s. Since then, increase in mirror size have not gained optical resolution, just raised the altitude at which a satellite can achieve that resolution from. The increase in mirror size from GAMBIT3 to KENNEN allowed the switch from a 'diving' orbit with a perigee seriously affected by atmospheric drag to the current long-term-stable orbits used today. Growing the mirror size further does not gain any useful features.

Quite true. That's why I mentioned the SIGINT satellites only; their huge mesh antennae aren't as demanding as optical mirrors. A Starship-sized SIGINT satellite could have a bigger antenna that takes less folding than the current ones, which would be cheaper to design & build. I can see SpaceX designing the chassis, with the NRO finding a provider for the rest. And yes, I'm speculating pretty far out on a limb here. SpaceX likes to design for mass production but for the amount of money the NRO throws at companies they'd probably make an exception.
its my understanding that Starshield uses already existing hardware. the difference is different software/capabilities and rates.
I hope the value of Starship to the US's national security needs will see the weight of the DoD and NRO put behind the effort to get environmental clearances pushed through expeditiously.
Same, doubly so because that will be helpful for Artemis, is this government really going to prioritize a lengthy environmental impact statement of 2 years for use of an existing rocket launch complex over getting it operational ASAP so it can serve both national security and national space objectives including our return to the moon? I hope not.
national space objectives including our return to the moon
Yup, Congress is taking note of the ambitious Chinese Moon program with its ambitious timeline.
Even if Starship never lives up to the name of being a fully reusable vehicle. The fact that the build cost of it would be less than a Falcon 9 launch ($65M) and it's launch cost would also be less than a Falcon 9 launch, and in a fully expendable mode, put 200T to LEO with each launch, would give the US government 2x the capacity to orbit over any adversarial nation and at a launch cadence 10x that of China and like 100x of that of Russia.
SpaceX currently is on Booster 11 and Ship 32. They've in the span of 2 years, built like 10x the upmass capacity of SLS, half of which could easily be procured by the DoD for its needs. 1000T to orbit expendable for less than a billion dollars all for DoD payloads is unheard of. Even if it ends up costing a billion dollars, that's still unheard of. Even if it costs 2, or 5, or even 10 billion dollars, that's still unheard of.
If they pull off full reusability. It gives the US total orbital supremacy in ways that completely changes how future wars would be fought.
$1.8Bn to help pull that off is pennies on the dollar compared to the cost of what it would take if old space was in charge.
The NRO sats are so huge because they are trying to intercept cell phone calls. From geo orbit you need a freaking huge collecting antenna. You know what’s easier? Intercepting from a couple hundred KM away. That would require putting a LTE radio on thousands of LEO sats. Hey that sounds like the TMobile deal!
The AST SpaceMobile design has gains that are substantially greater than the SpaceX design. Their phased array are massive and designed for a wider range of spectrum.
What if we used Starship to capture Russian and Chinese satellites? Even the ones design to capture American satellites. People often says that there is always a bigger fish, but Elon definitely has the bigger rocket. Solves the debris problem.
Ohh or what about interceptors designed to block anti-satellite missiles!
That would be an act of war, and basically impossible to do covertly.
Bigger isn't really the likely path forward for the NRO I think. Their optical surveillance is already high enough resolution for practically anything they could want. The issue is their temporal resolution is horrible. The value of thousands of mini-sats vastly outweighs the value of a few massive telescopes I think.",2024-02-20T15:23:16.103Z,SpaceInMyBrain,36.3

"Million-Dollar Home Sales Were Rare Around Pensacola. Now They’re Everywhere. - Wall Street Journal (Feb 16, 2024)","Pensacola marketing in overdrive today. Link, and text, posted from “Mansion Global” to bypass the WSJ paywall. Wonder how much Visit Pensacola paid for this write up?
While development certainly can be positive, who (besides Studer, Reeves, et al.) does it benefit? At what cost to those who have lived and worked here long before the downtown “revitalization”?

——
After Jennifer McKeown-Putney moved away from the Florida city of Pensacola in 2021, she could think of only one thing: moving back.
Located on the westernmost edge of the Florida panhandle and along the Pensacola Bay, the city is the site of America’s first multiyear European settlement, established over 400 years ago, according to the University of West Florida. Its metro area is made up of Escambia and Santa Rosa counties and includes the Pensacola Beach community and the small city of Gulf Breeze, which have frontage on the bay, the Santa Rosa Sound and the Gulf of Mexico.

,"This is silly. There aren't a bunch million dollar homes being built. There are just homes that now cost a million dollars that didn't before.
We sold our 50 year-old 4/2 in the Miami suburbs three years ago for close to $900k. Paid $165k in 1992. A million ain’t that big a thing any more. Pensacola housing still seems cheap compared to where we were. You can buy new homes outlying areas for $300k.
Inflation calculator puts $162k in ‘92 at $361k in ‘24, in case anyone was wondering…",2024-02-17T11:50:38.351Z,uncleawesome,43.3
,"Here’s my take on this:
Alright, buckle up, 'cause we're diving deep into the Pensacola ""Paradise"" Propaganda, and let me tell ya, it's about as subtle as a sledgehammer to your piggy bank. 🐷💸 So, the Wall Street Journal drops this bomb that million-dollar homes in Pensacola are sprouting up like mushrooms after a rainstorm. And who's behind this gold-plated curtain? None other than our pals Studer and co., turning downtown Pensacola into their own personal Monopoly board. 🎩🏦
Now, don't get it twisted; we're not hating on progress or revitalization. But when Jennifer McKeown-Putney can cash out her beach pad for a cool $4.4 mil only to snag a slice of downtown for $1.425 million, you gotta wonder who's really winning in this game of luxury real estate roulette. Hint: It ain't the average Joe or Jane, struggling to make rent in a city where the median sale price of homes is jumping faster than you can say ""gentrification.""
The pandemic apparently sprinkled some fairy dust on the market, making those million-dollar sales go brrr. But let's cut through the fluff. This ain't just about waterfront views and Mardi Gras parades. It's about treating homes like they're just another commodity to be flipped, traded, and hoarded by those with the fattest wallets, pushing real people with real jobs into a game of musical roommates just to keep a roof over their heads.
Quint Studer's downtown Disneyland might be a capitalist's dream, complete with baseball stadiums and bistros, but let's not forget the real cost. The revitalization train is steamrolling over the needs of the local community, turning a basic human right into a luxury item. And for what? So tourists can have a cute place to Instagram their vacations?
Sure, Pensacola's got its perks, and nobody's saying we should live in the past. But when the future looks like a playground for the rich, where locals are squeezed out of their own neighborhoods, you gotta call it like it is: a hot mess.
Housing as a right? A distant dream in this market. Treating it as a mere commodity? Now that's the real disgust. So next time you hear about how fab Pensacola's becoming, ask yourself: Fab for whom? 'Cause if the answer ain't ""everyone,"" we've got a problem. Pensacola, you deserve better. 🏠💔 #HousingIsARight #PensacolaForThePeople
This is well done 😂
Is this the ""affordable housing"" DC puppet was talking about?
Well done! I was thoroughly entertained by this response. That said, I’d like to play capitalist devil’s advocate for a minute.
More million dollar homes should equal more property tax income. This, in turn, allows the government to provide more, and potentially, higher quality services. What these services are, who exactly benefits from them, and their efficiency/effectiveness is the primary issue most people have with government. It seems to me that the Escambia Children’s Trust is an attempt to take this tax revenue and allocate it to those in greatest need. ECT has plenty of issues and is subject to political whims as is, but ECT and Pensacola’s most disadvantaged should be beneficiaries of the increase in million-dollar homes.
Wealthy residents invest in, and patronize, businesses that employ local citizens. How many Pensacola citizens work for Studer Group-affiliated companies? Is this a bad thing? Those who have moved their vacation homes from 30A to Pensacola Beach are also now going to spend more of their money in town. How many people work seasonal jobs in town that benefit from fat tips from tourists? Yes, this money trickles up more than it trickles down, but is it a net negative for the entire community?
Have Pensacola home prices, relative to wage gains, increased more than other cities in Florida? A 5-year median sales price increase of 58% is pretty drastic, but cities all over the US experienced similar inflation over the same period. According to FRED, (chart below) median wages in Escambia county have increased 16% from 2019-2022. Are these gains largely from remote workers or local wage increases? We all have anecdotes, but it’s helpful to also have context. I need to do more research here.
I’ll conclude by noting that this article is clearly a paid marketing piece targeting the wealthy. That alone is not necessarily negative, but our government’s, and business leaders’, primary focus on this demographic can lead to neglect (and even harm) of the majority of Pensacola citizens.
Oh, the sweet serenade of the capitalist devil's advocate, singing the siren song of trickle-down economics. Let's dive into this enchanted forest of million-dollar homes and see if we can't find our way back to reality, shall we?
First up, the ol' ""more property tax income equals better services"" tune. It's a classic hit, really, but like most hits, it tends to skip a few beats. The idea that a windfall from luxe estates will magically transform into public good is as whimsical as believing in unicorns. Sure, the Escambia Children’s Trust might snag a few extra bucks, but let's not pretend that turning every nook and cranny into a millionaire's row is the silver bullet for public welfare. It's a bit like saying, ""Let them eat cake,"" when the bakery's been turned into a gluten-free, artisanal cupcake shop only a few can afford. 🎂💸
Moving on to our wealthy residents who, bless their hearts, grace us with their presence and their penchant for high-end bistros and boutiques. Yes, they bring jobs – to serve them, to clean for them, to build their empires. But let's not confuse employment with empowerment. When the local economy caters to the whims of the affluent, we end up with a community designed not for living but for leisure. And those fat tips from tourists? They're not a foundation for a stable economy; they're the crumbs from the high table. 🍽️🥂
Now, let's tackle the argument that Pensacola's housing market inflation is just par for the course in Florida. Even if wage gains in Escambia County have seen an uptick, a 16% increase in wages doesn't hold a candle to a 58% surge in housing prices. This isn't about anecdotes; it's arithmetic. If your paycheck grows at a snail's pace while housing costs soar like a rocket, you're going to feel the squeeze. And let's not even start on remote workers inflating the market – that's a whole other can of worms. 📈💔
Lastly, yes, that article might as well have been penned with a golden quill for its unabashed catering to the wealthy. And here lies the rub: when our leaders and luminaries fixate on this gilded demographic, the majority are left in the dust. It's not just neglect; it's a systematic reshaping of our communities to serve a privileged few.
So, while the capitalist devil's advocate might have us believe in the benevolent hand of the market, let's not forget who that hand often slaps down. Housing isn't just another asset class; it's a fundamental human right. And until we protect it as such, all the property taxes in the world won't bridge the chasm between the haves and the have-nots. So let's redirect this symphony from a solo for the rich to a chorus for the community, where everyone's right to a home is the melody we all sing. 🏡✊ #HousingForAll
I come to Reddit to hear the propaganda of why Pensacola is bad. Thanks for the hard work bitching
Absolutely. All this money flowing into the area does not seem to be generating many decently paying jobs or doing anything to resolve the rental market crisis that was already existent.

Hell’s Kitchen - Daredevil
Seeing how small it is, I suddenly realize DD was basically just watching over 1 square mile while acting like the whole city is safe.
I don't think he was ""watching"" anything at all
NYC has been chipping away at Hells Kitchen since the late 60s, trying to gentrify the neighborhoods. One of those efforts created Clinton to the north, so when Daredevil was first made, and when Frank Miller et al. reimagined him in the 70s and early 80s, Hells Kitchen would have extended up to 59th Street. But yeah, making it two square miles isn't the same as protecting all of Manhattan.
DD was part of the 'street level' heroes in the comics. I think they are some of the best characters. Some of the best villians too.
Well, he just doesn't have the same mobility as Spiderman. So rather than try to compete with that it makes sense to work from home.
I guess with the density of people those 3 blocks can feel like a mid sized American town.
Dr. Strange's Sanctum Sanctorum is at 177A Bleecker St (Greenwich). Spider-Man lives at 20 Ingram St in Queens. The Fantastic Four live at 42nd and Madison (Midtown?). Avengers Mansion is 890 Fifth Avenue.
Tom Holland Spiderman is 46th st in Sunnyside IRL.
IIRC Sleepers also takes place in Hell's Kitchen
Tribeca - original ghostbusters firehouse
West Side (West Park) is Dana's apartment building (aka the Gozer portal) in Ghostbusters. Really neat building and you can see it well from the park.
I think that’s where it was SUPPOSED to be but the actual building is at the end of 5th Avenue at Washington Sq Park #god
EDIT: I’m wrong don’t believe me
…also friends
Could they afford the apartments now?
Friends apartment exterior is in West Village
Happy cake day
I got to visit that, it's still a real firehouse. If you ask nicely, the fire fighters have a Ghostbusters sign inside that they'll let you see. I got a photo taken with it, it was awesome.
Sigourney Weaver’s Apt attacked by Stay Puffed Mellow guy is Upper West Side

East Village - Russian Doll, Master of None

This map is every real estate agent's nightmare
Only a small part. MacLaren’s was elsewhere. “MacLaren's Pub is not a real place, but it is based on a real bar called McGee's, at 240 W. 55th St., where co-creators Craig Thomas and Carter Bays went out for drinks while working as writers for ""The Late Show with David Letterman.""
So it’s in midtown just north of the theater district, that is, if they kept the location for inspiration as well
Where was two broke girls again?
West Village - Friends
Makes their living situation even more unrealistic lol.
Mrs Maisel comments about ""midtown"" make more sense now...
Getting more specific with Maisel, it’s set kind of all over but has a lot of specificity to its locations.
Midge and her family live on the UWS, the basement comedy clubs are in Greenwich Village, most scenes set in offices or larger studios or theaters are in Midtown, Joel’s club later on is in Chinatown, the fabric business is classic Garment District, and the suburban house that the in-laws move to is in Forest Hills, Queens (several miles to the east)
Isn't Sesame Street meant to be in Harlem?
Will and Grace. Is that set in the UWS?
Anyone know where Suits is supposed to be? I know they filmed in Toronto.
Wolf of Wall Street - Wall Street
Wall Street - Wall Street
Wolf of Wall Street is not actually on Wall Street. Except for the first scene where he works at a firm, those guys were in an office park in Long Island.

Sex and the City: Charlotte upper East side
Sam- Meat Packing District
Carrie-- West Village
Miranda-- upper west side, then Brooklyn with Steve
Not actually shot there but FRIENDS is supposed to be Greenwich Village
Ooooooooh. So that's why they say ""in the village"". I always thought it was like slang for New York City or something lol

West Side (West Park) is Dana's apartment building (aka the Gozer portal) in Ghostbusters. Really neat building and you can see it well from the park.

Getting more specific with Maisel, it’s set kind of all over but has a lot of specificity to its locations.
Midge and her family live on the UWS, the basement comedy clubs are in Greenwich Village, most scenes set in offices or larger studios or theaters are in Midtown, Joel’s club later on is in Chinatown, the fabric business is classic Garment District, and the suburban house that the in-laws move to is in Forest Hills, Queens (several miles to the east)

There's a couple.
Midtown? A midtown gig?
Almost. 15th Street.
Wow. Midway to midtown.

Sesame Street's fictional location is Upper West, but it's filmed in Astoria Queens:

Which part did the avengers destroy?
Midtown, most of the Avengers climax is set around Grand Central Terminal and Park Avenue
30 Rock: Most of the action is in Midtown, but Liz Lemon lives on the Upper West Side (88th and Riverside Drive, specifically.) Fun fact is that they changed the address after the first couple seasons. It was the same as the IRL building at first but then they changed one of the numbers. I wonder if people in the building complained.
How come there was so few scenes in Central Park in Seinfeld if they were so close hmm
Because aside from stock establishing shots, it was all filmed in Los Angeles lol
Succession was definitely not the financial district.
Sure it is, the filming locations for the Waystar Royco building were the WTC and 28 Liberty St, both downtown.

Agreed. Live in the area and while I see “Clinton” on a few businesses on 10th Ave, nobody here calls it that. It’s Hell’s Kitchen from the river to 8th Ave, and from roughly 59th to 42nd
There is no such thing as Clinton!

,"Well this helps when watching SVU
Currently rewatching and I'm gonna save this map to my phone so I know wtf is going on
i could have used this map my entire life for movies and tv shows, also someone needs to make a cool guide to all the neighborhoods and maybe more importantly highways in LA
Also, Those neighborhoods are not that close. It’s a 40 min. -1 hr drive / 7 hour walk / 1.5 hr subway ride from Inwood to Tribeca on an empty Sunday morning. On a regular afternoon with NYC traffic jams you’re better off driving to Alaska (7 hrs was my longest traffic jam). So Spiderman might go months without running into Daredevil lol or in my case, living in Queens and visiting family in Harlem / The Bronx/ or even neighboring Brooklyn was years in between because how far it was LOL
Just checked and it's apparently about 12 miles from Inwood to Tribeca. According to Google maps right now on an empty Sunday morning at about 9:40 am it's a 28 minute drive, or a 4.5 hour walk. I'd say that's pretty close to standard for a lot of cities. In Phoenix AZ I do a shit ton of driving and I can tell you that with literally thousands of hours driving experience on average it's about 2 minutes per mile after factoring in all the times stopped at red lights. And the average adult walking pace is slightly below but around 3 mph. So factoring in time stopped waiting for the crosswalk light four and a half hours to walk 12 miles is pretty standard.
Kramer had a point not wanting to do long distance relationships.
Lovely walk from Inwood to Battery Park though- I used to make a day of it and walk down Broadway, or just meander.
Wholly agreed. I was surprised how long it took me to get from 4th to 50th during last Sunday. Ran late meeting a buddy of mine cuz I thought the traffic won’t be bad during Super Bowl - I was wrong
So… before I moved to nyc I binge watched every episode. WHY???? I literally didn’t leave my apartment for the first few weeks afterwards Lmao

There are more murders depicted on a season of Law and Order than there are in real life in Manhattan. And the real life ones are a lot more ""teenage drug dealer kills rival teenage drug dealer"" and a lot less art forgery schemes or whatever.

So factoring in time stopped waiting for the crosswalk light four and a half hours to walk 12 miles is pretty standard.",2024-02-18T14:45:31.790Z,psuedophilosopher,45.4.2.1

I grew up in Wagner houses. It was not fun.
Then we moved down to Riis houses on Ave d.
That shit was even worse in the 90s.
I’m guessing that was a spacing issue
Grew up there, def called it El Barrio along with East Harlem and Spanish Harlem depending on who I was talking to and what they knew about the area.
Also El Barrio literally just Means The Neighbourhood
El Barrio might be an old head name for it. I grew up calling it Spanish Harlem but knowing what El Barrio meant. I’d imagine it’s also more popular in the Latin community to say it too.
My dad has lived or been a cop, including there, in almost every part of the city and him and all his friends call it El Barrio. They’re all mostly Hispanic too.

Coinbase Shares Surge After It Crushes Wall Street Expectations,"Coinbase (COIN) shares surged after the U.S.-based cryptocurrency exchange beat analysts' estimates for fourth-quarter earnings and revenue, benefitting from soaring crypto prices.
It earned $1.04 per share, beating the average analyst estimate of $0.02 per share, according to FactSet data. Revenue of $953.8 million also exceeded the analyst forecast of $826.1 million, the company said in a statement.
Shares of the crypto exchange rose about 13% in post-market trading after adding about 3% during the regular session. COIN shares had fallen about 4% this year, even as the price of bitcoin (BTC) surged about 23%.
""We’re really pleased with the results,” Anil Gupta, vice president of investor relations at Coinbase told CoinDesk in an interview. “Operational rigor that we set forth early in the year really paid off over the course of 2023.”
That seemed to translate into more business at Coinbase. It saw 100% more trading volume during the quarter versus the third quarter. Fourth-quarter volume amounted to $154 billion, ahead of the estimate of $142.7 billion.

Walmart beats Wall Street’s holiday expectations as e-commerce sales soar,"Walmart said Tuesday that quarterly revenue rose 6%, as shoppers turned to the big-box retailer throughout the holiday season and the company’s global e-commerce sales grew by double digits.
The retail giant also announced Tuesday that it would acquire smart TV maker Vizio to accelerate growth of its advertising business. Walmart is acquiring the company for $2.3 billion, or $11.50 per share.
In a CNBC interview, Chief Financial Officer John David Rainey said customers have still shown discretion with purchases. They are putting fewer items in their baskets but shopping more frequently, he said. Electronics, TVs, computers and some other expensive items have been a tougher sell, Rainey added.
Yet, he said even after the holiday rush, Walmart saw continued sales strength.
Here’s what Walmart reported compared with what Wall Street was expecting, based on a survey of analysts by LSEG, formerly known as Refinitiv:

Wall Street Journal: The Newest Trump Trade: Betting on Truth Social in an Election Year,"https://archive.is/XFRub#selection-5749.0-5749.67
Excerpts:
""Donald Trump meme-stock mania is back.
Shares in the company planning to merge with Truth Social, the former president’s social-media platform, are up about 190% this year, joining a broad rally in speculative investments from thinly traded stocks to cryptocurrencies. Digital World Acquisition Corp. hopes to combine with Truth Social to take it public. 
The renewed fervor around the company, which trades under the ticker DWAC, is reminiscent of the surge in GameStop and other beaten-down shares during the pandemic. 
In a chat room on Truth Social called DWAC, more than 5,500 users have been sharing memes and their trading gains in recent weeks as Trump moves closer to clinching the Republican nomination for president.

,"What is the TLDR of this? Asking for a friend and definitely NOT because I know nothing about Finance…
Colleges have a pot of money sitting around called the “endowment fund”.
That money is invested in things like stocks, bonds, and real estate.
Colleges use the annual profits from their investments to pay for nice things like scholarship, and fancy new buildings. Baylor made more profits than expected, which is a good thing, because it means that there is more money available to spend on buildings staff salary and more money available to give away for scholarship. Investing is risky and it always possible that Baylor could lose money in investing. But in recent years Baylor has done a very good job at investing their endowment fund, and this means more money for good thing.
To put numbers to it: in recent years, Baylor has made ~$200m in annual profits from the investments of its $2 billion endowment funds, when what is more typical for a $2b endowment fund is perhaps ~$100m in annual profits. Colleges usually reinvest half of annual profits back into the original pot to grow the base size (the bigger the size of the fund, the better, all else equal). Anywho, in 2019, Baylor likely thought “we’ll probably get $100m in investing profits in 2024, which means $50m in “free money” that we can give away.” However, since they just earned ~$200m in investing profits last year, after putting half back in the original pot (to reinvest), Baylor now has $100m in “free money” (profits) to give away in 2024, or $50m more than they ever could have anticipated way back in 2019. Baylor now has far more “extra money” to spend than what could have been realistically expected.
As a private university who does not get the annual funds from the public, endowments are super important to the financial health of the university.

"SpaceX won a $1.8 billion classified contract with the U.S. government in 2021, according to company documents viewed by The Wall Street Journal","



",2024-02-20T14:32:52.086Z,spacerfirstclass,140
,"The title of the article is ""Musk’s SpaceX Forges Tighter Links With U.S. Spy and Military Agencies"", but most of the content are things we already know, the $1.8B classified contract is the real news. Some additional information from the article:
The Elon Musk-led company entered into a $1.8 billion classified contract with the U.S. government in 2021, according to company documents viewed by The Wall Street Journal. SpaceX said in the documents that funds from the contract were expected to become an important part of its revenue mix in the coming years. It didn’t disclose the name of the government customer.
...
The company has also won significant national-security clients for its satellite technologies—a different set of offerings from SpaceX’s traditional work blasting off satellites for those customers. One such client has been the National Reconnaissance Office, according to people familiar with the matter.
It couldn’t be determined what satellite technology from SpaceX the NRO has tapped.
...
Terrence O’Shaughnessy, who joined SpaceX after retiring in 2020 from the Air Force as a general, has had a high-level role at Starshield, people familiar with the matter said. A biography posted on a trade group’s website described him as a “Senior Advisor to Elon Musk on matters regarding SpaceX” as well as vice president of the company’s Special Programs Group.
He and others have urged the defense establishment to learn from the example set by more agile space startups. Last year, O’Shaughnessy compared how SpaceX developed Starlink with a government effort to create a similar but far smaller fleet. The latter “sounds a lot like Starlink,” he said at a conference. “Yet they’re looking for a couple hundred satellites on orbit.”
 
My guess is the classified contract is for what is now known as StarShield. SpaceX has been hiring people like crazy for StarShield, I wondered before how they can do this without a customer.
The NRO would die for a couple hundred or thousand cell phone towers orbiting within a couple hundred KM of everywhere in earth. They have sunk so much money trying to make radios and antennas sensitive enough to eavesdrop on cell phones from geo orbit. Spacex has just shown that using a shitload of smaller satellites closer to the ground is feasible. And now v2 has actual LTE radios on them thanks to T Mobile - officially anyway, I actually suspect the US government played a bigger role in that than T-Mobile.
Am I dumb if I get excited thinking each satellite may have optics as well? AI could look at all the boring ocean images and find ships that were otherwise impossible to track.
No need for optics. Not that much useful info to get from optics in LEO, and it would be too noticeable / expensive to put a big enough aparture on each SL that would be better than a MEO keyhole.
Can you imagine what the resolution of a spy satellite with a 9m lenses would be? They could probably count blades of grass with that.
Good news, revenue for SpaceX, more launch biz and probably some high value Starshield related results for the DoD/IC. Probably see more ""classified"" payloads in the mix toward the end of the year.",2024-02-20T14:33:17.655Z,spacerfirstclass,141.1

https://www.space.com/spacex-starshield-space-force-contract
SpaceX is not known for high-fidelity High End sat tech, they are very good integrator of offtheshelf products.
On the other hand NRO launches are usually classified partially or completely. Most probably they write about blank contract on launching x-37 coupled with required ""research"" of project ""integration"" with corresponding security walls etc. Wouldn't be surprised if it includes use of Starship. Since they don't mention contracts deadlines the whole subj is moot. (SpaceX starts only now receiving ""Artemis"" money, and it is few 100s millions only so far)
Usual WSJ garbage.
SpaceX already got around 1.5 billion of Artemis money. It's well past the beginning.
lol obligated is not the same as realized. (current number is 2.2bln obligated of 3.6 awarded). Outlayed is not the same as paid (NASA is an active paid participant in HLS contract so even real transfers don't tell the full picture).

Would it be possible to use the transceivers of Starlink satellites as synthetic aperture radar arrays? Perhaps it might be difficult and low resolution, but if it could track a ship in the ocean it would absolutely be useful. Also, if Starlink satellites were used in this way that should be detectable at ground level with a software defined radio on the same frequency.

The counter to this is that Nvidia is manipulating it's stock price/cooking its books through dummy corporations, supply side financing, and capital genesis. The shelf life on chips is about 5 years, and will probably get lower over time, so they would need an immediate practical use for chips besides using them as collateral for loans in order to justify it's current market-cap.
Is there evidence?
Sorry if I made it sound like I was asserting that. I meant to add “some are saying,” because while it comes up in things I listen to, it is not really something I’m following. I know supply side financing exists and it’s a way to mislead about profits and balances. I don’t know if Nvidia is doing this. But it’s not far fetched.
I know companies have been exposed for fraud/capital genesis, and the method Nvidia could go about it isn’t far fetched.
Invest: 400 million in shell company X to increase valuation by $400M overnight. Attract investors.
Have X buy $400 mil worth of chips. Nvidia makes $400M overnight.
Nvidia suppresses chip production. Cost of existing chips doubles and triples. X now owns $1 billion worth of chips. And increases its market cap $1B since the day before Nvidia gave it $400M that it gave right back. Plus, whatever it was able to attract from investment and buy more chips with.

,"This might be a silly question, but does TSMC actually have the WSA capacity to support that kind of sales growth in the latest tech nodes given contractual capacity commitments to other customers?
If TSMC can't fab it, Nvidia can't sell it. I see a ton of people talking about Nvidia 'making' chips, but they're fabless. Without TSMC (Samsung isn't really an option for them) and OAST support for packaging, can they triple or quadruple their hardware sales? I don't see them tripling the price while staying on the same node, so they've got to move more inventory.
Their demands already exceed TSMC's CoWoS packaging capacity.

"UA POV - Ukraine is fighting an adversary with much deeper reserves of manpower and ammunition, leaving Kyiv reliant on Western help - The Wall Street Journal","OCHERETYNE, Ukraine—The consequences of politics in Washington are playing out in Oleksander Kucheriavenko’s Humvee on the eastern front of Ukraine’s war against Russia.
On a patrol Wednesday, Kucheriavenko, a sergeant, fired several grenade rounds from his armored vehicle at a Russian assault team—and then stopped, to conserve ammunition. Like many Ukrainian soldiers, Kucheriavenko is concerned that Republican attempts to block additional military aid to Kyiv will strip them of already-scarce ammunition, armored vehicles and spare parts, rendering defense against Russian onslaughts even harder.
A national-security focused bill that includes about $60 billion of funding for Ukraine has been held up in Washington for months as some Republicans use its passage to extract political concessions or to protest the war’s growing price tag. Early Tuesday, , which includes additional amounts for Israel and Taiwan, by 70 votes to 29. The bill now goes to the Republican-controlled House, where it faces an uncertain fate amid the greater power of Ukraine skeptics and the influence of Republican presidential front-runner , .

Wall Street Giants Expect a Bombshell in the Crypto Sector in May: “The SEC’s Hands Are Tied”,"The cryptocurrency industry and Wall Street are eagerly awaiting potential approval of a spot Ethereum ETF as early as May by U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Chairman Gary Gensler, according to FOX Business reporter Eleanor Terrett.
Sentiment surrounding the approval of a spot ETF for Ethereum, the world's second-largest digital asset, in 2024 is overwhelmingly positive. This view is shared not only in the crypto industry, but also among securities lawyers and traditional Wall Street firms.
However, there are skeptics who point to Gensler's past indecisiveness regarding ETH's legality and suitability for an ETF. They argue that ETH has a less broad base or institutional support than Bitcoin, the first and most valuable digital asset in the financial sector.
Despite these concerns, many securities lawyers believe that the legal precedent set in the approval process for spot Bitcoin ETFs creates a blueprint for Ethereum counterparts to likely follow.

maybe i should stick with my original plan of teaching at uni which i might enjoy more but it's hard to get into without a phd.
Getting a teaching gig at a university without a doctorate is borderline impossible. Even if you find one, you'll spend half a decade or more spinning your chair in post-docs before finding a seasonal lecturer job. You might not ever find a substantive position without playing the ""let's move the family to middle of nowhere university"".
Most of my friends who've stayed at, or near, their universities are still seasonal. That includes my friends who went straight into doctoral programs from our bachelor's in 2005 and my fellow doctoral students in 2009.
Also, in 2009/2010 nobody really gave a fuck about teaching and learning - everybody gave a fuck about how much grant money you were pulling in.
Look at phd jobs on seek. Pay is decent, but all contract, and they have upper limits on when you last finished your phd rather than lower limits. It's pretty grim for such a tedious qualification to get... 
I want to add how fucking crazy the job market is in academia.
I have a friend who's been published as the lead researcher in a major journal (the best you can get published in her field) a dozen times in 17 years and has multiple publications in smaller journals. She's well-regarded by her fellow academics, her students, and the industries she works with. On top of that, her classes are always pretty full; students select her classes over others because they value her knowledge and instruction. For the vast majority of her seasonal lecturing position, she was fully funded with research grants with industry support.
She was a seasonal lecturer for 17 years.
Could you imagine someone who's pretty much at the top of their game being forced into seasonal roles and not being snapped up by any of the local universities into a substantive position? She was open to working at any of the universities that were somewhat close to home, but she had family commitments that required her to stay near Brisbane. So, Sunshine Coast, Toowoomba, and the Gold Coast were all on the cards for a substantive position. She only stayed in Brisbane because one seasonal job was the same as another. Why go to Toowoomba as a seasonal lecturer if you can stay at UQ/QUT/GU and be closer to your family?
It's insane.
She was lucky that she was a seasonal lecturer. I know plenty of good researchers with immense technical skills who were stuck in post-doc positions for up to a decade before either leaving or getting a seasonal lecturer position. Imagine being phenomenal at highly technical and sort-after skills for your working prime, only not to be able to get a substantive job out of it.
I only know three people from my time at university who won a substantive position, and all of them were tapped on the shoulder by the leader of their research group.
I've told this story multiple times, but when I was doing my doctorate, I went on an adventure to UNSW with my doctoral advisor and her research group to talk to influential people about stuff (I was mainly there to listen). Anyway, at the end of the session, the dean of one of the schools referred to post-docs and doctoral students as gypsies roaming the university grounds looking for food.
I don't think he meant to be a bigot. I think he was trying to say that they are everywhere, and they are stuck in poverty loops because the system enforces it. Universities don't want substantive staff. They want casual staff so that they can fuck you off the moment it becomes convenient for them to do so.
On top of this, the workplace is problematic. Nobody gives a shit about teaching and learning. Not really.
Sure, if an entire cohort marches up to the dean's office and tells them that you were selling distinctions for dates with girls or you provide evidence that you are technically incompetent, something might get done. But other than that, probably not.
The only thing universities give two fucks about is how much money you bring in outside of teaching. You need to be publishing and you need to be bringing in research funding.
If you aren't doing both of those, you're out.
My doctoral advisor pushed for me to be published in my first year of a doctoral program. What the fuck did I know about my topic in the first year of my doctorate? Not a lot.
It basically ends up with people working 1 job as a teacher and 1 job as a researcher.
I concluded that academia wasn't a good place to work when I'd email my doctoral advisor at 1 or 2 in the morning (which was fine for a doctoral student) and my professor would immediately reply because she was up doing research.
I love academics, but money-grubbing executives have killed the Academy in leadership.
Is she you?
Yep. I'm not a super academic type. Job is perfect for me. For some others who are hardcore into their content and subjects, it can be frustrating outside of the private sector. Public schools are all relationships and behaviour. Content is secondary and maths is not even close to Uni level so you end up teaching multiplication of negatives to Y8 over 2 weeks.

,"Before you make any firm plans, please have a read through all the other topics on this group so you’re going into it with eyes wide open. There is a reason why there’s a teacher shortage, why so many existing teachers are leaving the profession, and so few people taking up teaching.
Behavior - especially in high school - is a huge factor and something people just don’t appreciate until they’ve been in a classroom.
Are you prepared to have a class of teenagers who treat you with contempt, snigger behind your back, talk over you while you’re trying to teach or verbally and physically abuse you? And when you try to discipline them you get no support from admin and there are no consequences for the student?
And this happens not just 20 minutes a week but potentially every lesson, every day?
Unfortunately that’s the reality for many, many teachers.
Workload is a huge issue. It keeps increasing and most of it isn’t about how and what you teach but bureaucratic a** covering because someone five levels above you doesn’t want to be caught out on something.
Then there are students with “complex needs”, a euphemism for students who might not actually be able to function in an actual classroom but who are there because society has deemed they should be mainstreamed but that same society (government) has provided you - the teacher - with no additional support to meet the needs of this particular child.
Simply loving a subject and being knowledgeable at it is not by itself enough unfortunately.
Teaching can be incredibly rewarding. At the same time, there are many issues impacting the profession and teachers’ longevity in it.

.@Bloomberg's @reporterev reports that banks are pushing back against @FDICgov's proposal to strengthen corporate governance & risk management of banks and their leadership. However, studies show that bank boards all failed miserably in 2008 and in the 2023 banking crisis.
In our comment letter, we supported @FDICgov's proposal, noting that firms should be held accountable for appropriate corporate governance and risk management to protect all stakeholders and the financial system. news.bloomberglaw.com/banking-law/ba…
FDIC’S PROPOSAL TO IMPROVE BANKS’ GOVERNANCE AND RISK MANAGEMENT WILL HELP PREVENT FAILURES AND CRASHES THAT DEVASTATE MAIN STREET
WASHINGTON, D.C.— Dennis M. Kelleher, Co-Founder, President, and CEO, issued the following statement on the filing of Better Markets’ Comment Letter to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), urging them to adopt improved and enforceable guidelines for corporate governance and risk management structures for the largest banks.
“Unlike most other corporations, the consequences of large banks being poorly run can be catastrophic to innocent hardworking Americans. To avoid that, bank boards of directors are charged with ensuring that banks have robust risk management and internal control frameworks, and effectively overseeing senior management. Unfortunately, those bank boards all failed miserably in 2008, as did the bank boards involved in the 2023 banking crisis, and that contributed significantly to the banking crises, which both times lead to contagion and bailouts. These crises once again demonstrated how inadequate corporate governance is and how much it needs to be strengthened.
“The FDIC’s proposal represents a crucial step towards better protecting the financial system from banking collapses and their fallout by raising the standards and expectations for board and management structures at large banks to align with the dangers they pose to the American people. Mismanagement, recklessness, negligence, and ignorance can no longer be tolerated. The proposal has several strengths, including greater detail on expectations for both the board and management, as well as the enforceability of these requirements. We also applaud the FDIC’s support of the need for board diversity but encourage more focus on the need for greater banking expertise. Board members must have sufficient knowledge and skills to effectively fulfill their fiduciary duties at large and complex banks.
“Importantly, this proposal is tailored and targeted at the greatest risks that can cause the greatest damage, which is why it applies to only 57 of the 3,012 banks that the FDIC supervises. The FDIC should promptly approve and implement these long overdue and much needed requirements.”",2024-02-14T18:52:13.869Z,awwshitGents,207.2

"Toast will lay off 10% of its workforce, about 550 employees, as growth slows","Toast, maker of restaurant management software, said on Thursday it will let go of 550 employees, about 10% of its workforce. The company also reported fourth-quarter earnings that surpassed Wall Street’s expectations.
Shares were initially up as much as 16% after hours but then gave back much of the gains.
Here’s how the company did, compared with the consensus among analysts polled by LSEG, formerly known as Refinitiv:
Earnings per share: Loss of 7 cents per share, vs. loss of 11 cents per share expected
Revenue: $1.04 billion vs. $1.02 billion expected
Toast’s revenue increased almost 35% year over year during the quarter, according to a statement. Its net loss of $36 million narrowed from $99 million in the year-ago quarter. The company has committed $250 million for share buybacks.
The pandemic lead many restaurants to adopt Toast’s tools for mobile ordering and payments, which helped double the company’s revenue. Shares debuted on the New York Stock Exchange in 2021, in the midst of that uptick. Demand has cooled since then, down from 37% in the third quarter and about 45% in the second quarter.

By boosting tip guilt across America
I never tip all this new crap. Only sit down waited on, not a single other thing
I agree but the issue is people are tipping for every little thing because they feel bad not giving a tip. So many god damn service employees now expect tips for doing nothing and will get pouty or be rude to you when you don’t leave a tip.
I got takeout the other day. Normally I tip $1 for takeout. I had to walk into the restaurant to pick up my food so they didn’t even walk to my car to deliver it. I decided not to tip because the food was late. Well the girl whose job it is to prepare the take out orders ( all she does is organize the takeout orders from the kitchen) literally asked to my face if I was going to tip her. I told her sorry and she made this huge stink about it. If you don’t like your pay take that up with your boss or find another job. It’s not my job to subsidize your low wage from the restaurant.
I’ve always tipped carry out in a steakhouse type setting where they may have a designated carry out employee that has to put your orders together, but only 5-10% it’s not full service.
Yes. I could hear the indignation from the cashier as I selected Other and entered 0% at a fast food restaurant where I get my name called and bus my own table.
I tip for actual service, not subsidizing an owners next yacht.
It's an act of tough love, really.
Eventually that cashier will leave for a better job once they realize the boss is a lying sack of shit who promised $18/hr but only pays $10/hr and ""expects tips to average it up""
Tipping cashiers just encourages ownership to keep bait-and-switching new hires so they can pay less and guilt-trip their caring customers to make up for their greed.
sales, client support, billing/collections, hardware, software, recruiting, internal finance, tech, marketing, investor relations, strategy
it easily can boil up and grow.
To 5000 people?
From an outsider POV it should be 500-1000 headcount company.
It’s tricky because the clientele they service are typically NOT tech savvy. The sales process and the install takes handholding, and they’re still way understaffed on the support side.
Restaurant tech product manager here that has worked closely with Toast in the past and works with another PM who came from Toast.
One take: Toast has an absolute shit ton of sales reps. Like whatever high number you're now thinking, easily double or triple it.
500 employees would be $8 million in annual revenue per employee, which is exceptionally high, especially for a growing tech software company with 30,000 business clients.
Sales alone you can start getting pretty big.
Figure 1-3 sales reps per state. Then you probably have a district or regional manager for every 5-10 states depending on sales. Then a couple people above them. Then the marketing to support all of that.
Just between sales and marketing you're probably at 200-300 people minimum.
you sound like you only have 500-1000 braincells
and what the fuck do you know about tech companies as an outsider?

Well the girl whose job it is to prepare the take out orders ( all she does is organize the takeout orders from the kitchen) literally asked to my face if I was going to tip her. I told her sorry and she made this huge stink about it. If you don’t like your pay take that up with your boss or find another job.

Eventually that cashier will leave for a better job once they realize the boss is a lying sack of shit who promised $18/hr but only pays $10/hr and ""expects tips to average it up""

To 5000 people?
From an outsider POV it should be 500-1000 headcount company.
It’s tricky because the clientele they service are typically NOT tech savvy. The sales process and the install takes handholding, and they’re still way understaffed on the support side.
Restaurant tech product manager here that has worked closely with Toast in the past and works with another PM who came from Toast.
One take: Toast has an absolute shit ton of sales reps. Like whatever high number you're now thinking, easily double or triple it.
500 employees would be $8 million in annual revenue per employee, which is exceptionally high, especially for a growing tech software company with 30,000 business clients.
Sales alone you can start getting pretty big.
Figure 1-3 sales reps per state. Then you probably have a district or regional manager for every 5-10 states depending on sales. Then a couple people above them. Then the marketing to support all of that.
Just between sales and marketing you're probably at 200-300 people minimum.

Fun fact: Ford’s CEO is Chris Farley’s cousin. I believe his Twitter bio even says something like “I do not live in a van down by the river.”
What a small world. Chris Farley was also a key executive and sales representative for Callahan Auto Parts, a major supplier from the Midwest back in the 1990s. I recall seeing a documentary about his experience saving the company.
It's a pretty heartwarming story. The son takes over the company after the death of his father and saves the company from the brink of bankruptcy, saving the jobs of hundreds of people.

I wouldn't say that, it's just not compelling for the price. I have an f150 and it's a great reliable truck. I've had quite a a few Ford's. Personally I'd rather have that than a GM or dodge. Had both and they were not anything to write home about.

,"Meanwhile
Elon: Forget Tesla, Chinese cars are so much better than us, thank god for import tariffs.
I don’t know how teslas will compete with Chinese EVs but Chinese companies will bury Ford and VW in international markets.
Today, almost 50% of ford’s sales are from outside of north America. In a decade, they are going to lose majority of their overseas sales to Chinese EVs.
BYD etc are already shipping dozens of models to Australia, Europe, South Asia etc. ford, VW are nowhere to be found.
Ford and GM will become a primarily North American companies and get wiped out elsewhere.
Europe will start putting up tariffs on Chinese cars. Too much of Germany and other economies are build on auto. It impacts too many people
EU expected their car dominance in China to be forever. Its no longer a thing.
Yep, and it will hurt them. Badly. But they can’t let BYD or others destroy VW in their home market.
You talk about Chinese markets as if there isn’t a heavy degree of centralized control…
Maybe, but VAG (particularly Porsche) makes a lot of money from china.
Calls on Chinese Vag.

Uncle Sam does twofers, US customes impounded high end VW's yesterday (Bentley and Audi) because they have one part made by a sanctioned Chinese firm
Chinese cars are just rip offs of European and American cars. There’s no way they’d allow them to sell there
when you consider the heavy subsidies that VW and BMW get from the german government, that goes without saying.

(Every major automotive manufacturer enjoys subsidies and protections from their respective governments.)
GM is for me already an NA car maker. In western Europe you don't see them really anywhere. At least in my opinion
They used to own the largest selling car brand here in Australia (Holden), but they shut the whole thing down a few years back, not just local production, but sales as well. Holden is no more.
Not enough government handouts apparently.
Australia is a tiny market that can’t support domestic brands. Several US states each have more people in them
Depends a lot on what happens with western relations towards china moving forward. Chinese manufacturers 100% is backed by government funding, meaning they are probably going to have to relay on the west to continue trade and not introduce tariffs
Also not start wars that cause sanctions.
At least Tesla knows what's coming by competing in China.
Lol is this a CCP propoganda bot or something? Chinese cars have been terrible forever and the EVs are poorly reversed engineered Teslas.
source?
made it up but trust me bro
Not really. Even when looking at tesla model3, the ones that are made in China have far better reliance and panel uniformity than the ones made in the USA. It's like saying KIA Is a bad car company. So 2000 and late
Ya whats the metric you use for KIAs being good? They don’t drive well, they make the easiest cars to steal, and all that to still be less reliable than a Toyota
This is an attitude of Westerners stuck in the 90s. It's no different to how Japan's car manufacturing industry was seen in the 50s or Korea's industry.
China is one of the leaders in battery technology, they have a high-tech manufacturing industry with extremely reliable chains. BYD is eating up Tesla in Western markets where they operate due to its price difference and the general consensus is they are great vehicles, especially for the price.
It’s a lot different.  Japan has a national culture of fastidious quality control.  China has a national culture of copying stuff and then running everything into the ground.  
I don't think you can say that anymore about Chinese cars. The Chinese made Teslas are actually higher quality than the American made Teslas. From what I've been reading about BYD, the quality is pretty comparable. BYD can also sell their cars cheaper because of vertical integration and cheaper Chinese labor.
You forgot the important bit. They're cheap as hell, doubly so compared to US/EU EVs.

Do they suck? Absolutely. But Chinese junk has demolished existing brands in tons of markets for a long time now - the mass consumer only care about buying the cheapest thing.
Additionally, the EU is freaking out right now about implementing restrictions on Chinese EVs since they are right this second wreaking havoc on domestic EV manufacturers. And in the post your replying to, Elon is claiming trade barriers are necessary to prevent Chinese EVs from demolishing EV rivals. ← That's nearly a direct quote too; look it up.
I wouldn't be long any EV manufacturer right now, things ain't lookin great. Only when chinese cars catch fire and explode en masse or something will anyone care, and that's a 50/50 shot at just getting EVs banned outright.
They aren't though. The BYD seal in the EU market is $45,000, while the model 3 is $46,000. Thats not even competitive when you consider the Seal has a basically non-functional infotainment system, which is the centerpoint of an EV.
None of those cars meet environmental and safety requirements lol 
Honestly some of those Chinese EVs look so much better than anything we get in North America, especially when it comes to interior and materials. We still have 20k car interiors in 100k vehicles, it's ridiculous. These Chinese cars seem better and cheaper, but I'm sure we'll find a way to make them unaffordable, you know, ""to protect us"".
Ford and GM build junk vehicles. And our government regulations forces even more computerized junk in them. I miss the old reliable vehicles.
I don’t know when the last time you’ve owned one but their trucks are fantastic. 10x as powerful, better mpgs than ever, and plush interiors
Anyone who's ever owned a Chinesium battery for longer than 2 years knows not to worry about Chinese electric cars.
People dont even know. Youd figure with all the exploding chinese e-scooters that they wouldnt fuck with their cars
Ironically, many are sold into China. They’re even regarded as premium.
Nobody in China considers anything but European cars to be premium.
China is only limited by the number of Ships that can transport cars overseas, and they have like a dozen or so coming online in the next year or so. BYD exports about to explode.
You're putting alot of faith in China to not collapse into a civil war in the next 10 years.
Prove me wrong but I think Europeans have about the same impressions of Chinese made shit as Americans
Ford is saying the exact same thing.
https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/ford-ceo-says-china-main-ev-rival-not-gm-toyota-2023-05-25/
Never had he said that they are better than Tesla cars, he has complimented thier work to say they are worthy competitors though.
The Chinese evs are going to absolutely dominate the global market. It won’t be until the us removes the tariffs that they can dominate the us ev market as well. Of course congress won’t allow that cause it would hurt American jobs so they will bar us from getting the best tech
They'll just do what the Japanese did to get around Tariffs.
Build factories in the US. Or just in North America (NAFTA) and establish US operations, then unlike the Japanese move their ""HQ"" to Singapore and push forward. They'll probably use a different brand to get around the BYD naming issue. Then start by undercutting everyone (Imagine a 300+ mile range EV for $20k with 250kw or 300kw charging rates) A lot of Chinese brands have been ""moving"" from the Mainland to Singapore, which is a neutral country no one fucks with (Unless they want to rock the global trading markets) to get around a lot of US sanctions and tariffs.
Doesn't matter, Tesla is really a robot company anyway
Until they come out with a self-cleaning BJ robot, they’re still a power generation / vehicle company. BJ Robot = World Donination
Boston dynamics would like a word with you.
and it would be financial suicide to buy a non tesla when you can just run it in robo taxi mode while not in use
Teslas are high end fast luxury EVs byd is slow budget, like the honda civic of evs. It's like saying forget BMW and mercedes AMG, because ford falcons are better
Pretty sure he was referencing Europe with that statement. They are in for a Chinese takeover from their legacy makers mostly. U.S. already has tariff's and the IRA helps with domestic production on top of that. Europe is considering protection measures though.
Where the Chinese are doing well are in segments Tesla do not market too like the sub 25k car market.
With the housing market their imploding and deflation hitting their economy I'd be worried that those companies fold before they can develop an export market.",2024-02-15T18:34:44.425Z,elysiansaurus,238.4
,"I don’t know how teslas will compete with Chinese EVs but Chinese companies will bury Ford and VW in international markets.
Today, almost 50% of ford’s sales are from outside of north America. In a decade, they are going to lose majority of their overseas sales to Chinese EVs.
BYD etc are already shipping dozens of models to Australia, Europe, South Asia etc. ford, VW are nowhere to be found.
Ford and GM will become a primarily North American companies and get wiped out elsewhere.
Europe will start putting up tariffs on Chinese cars. Too much of Germany and other economies are build on auto. It impacts too many people
EU expected their car dominance in China to be forever. Its no longer a thing.
Yep, and it will hurt them. Badly. But they can’t let BYD or others destroy VW in their home market.
You talk about Chinese markets as if there isn’t a heavy degree of centralized control…
Maybe, but VAG (particularly Porsche) makes a lot of money from china.
Calls on Chinese Vag.

Uncle Sam does twofers, US customes impounded high end VW's yesterday (Bentley and Audi) because they have one part made by a sanctioned Chinese firm
Chinese cars are just rip offs of European and American cars. There’s no way they’d allow them to sell there
when you consider the heavy subsidies that VW and BMW get from the german government, that goes without saying.

(Every major automotive manufacturer enjoys subsidies and protections from their respective governments.)
GM is for me already an NA car maker. In western Europe you don't see them really anywhere. At least in my opinion
They used to own the largest selling car brand here in Australia (Holden), but they shut the whole thing down a few years back, not just local production, but sales as well. Holden is no more.
Not enough government handouts apparently.
Australia is a tiny market that can’t support domestic brands. Several US states each have more people in them
Depends a lot on what happens with western relations towards china moving forward. Chinese manufacturers 100% is backed by government funding, meaning they are probably going to have to relay on the west to continue trade and not introduce tariffs
Also not start wars that cause sanctions.
At least Tesla knows what's coming by competing in China.
Lol is this a CCP propoganda bot or something? Chinese cars have been terrible forever and the EVs are poorly reversed engineered Teslas.
source?
made it up but trust me bro
Not really. Even when looking at tesla model3, the ones that are made in China have far better reliance and panel uniformity than the ones made in the USA. It's like saying KIA Is a bad car company. So 2000 and late
Ya whats the metric you use for KIAs being good? They don’t drive well, they make the easiest cars to steal, and all that to still be less reliable than a Toyota
This is an attitude of Westerners stuck in the 90s. It's no different to how Japan's car manufacturing industry was seen in the 50s or Korea's industry.
China is one of the leaders in battery technology, they have a high-tech manufacturing industry with extremely reliable chains. BYD is eating up Tesla in Western markets where they operate due to its price difference and the general consensus is they are great vehicles, especially for the price.
It’s a lot different.  Japan has a national culture of fastidious quality control.  China has a national culture of copying stuff and then running everything into the ground.  
I don't think you can say that anymore about Chinese cars. The Chinese made Teslas are actually higher quality than the American made Teslas. From what I've been reading about BYD, the quality is pretty comparable. BYD can also sell their cars cheaper because of vertical integration and cheaper Chinese labor.
You forgot the important bit. They're cheap as hell, doubly so compared to US/EU EVs.

Do they suck? Absolutely. But Chinese junk has demolished existing brands in tons of markets for a long time now - the mass consumer only care about buying the cheapest thing.
Additionally, the EU is freaking out right now about implementing restrictions on Chinese EVs since they are right this second wreaking havoc on domestic EV manufacturers. And in the post your replying to, Elon is claiming trade barriers are necessary to prevent Chinese EVs from demolishing EV rivals. ← That's nearly a direct quote too; look it up.
I wouldn't be long any EV manufacturer right now, things ain't lookin great. Only when chinese cars catch fire and explode en masse or something will anyone care, and that's a 50/50 shot at just getting EVs banned outright.
They aren't though. The BYD seal in the EU market is $45,000, while the model 3 is $46,000. Thats not even competitive when you consider the Seal has a basically non-functional infotainment system, which is the centerpoint of an EV.
None of those cars meet environmental and safety requirements lol 
Honestly some of those Chinese EVs look so much better than anything we get in North America, especially when it comes to interior and materials. We still have 20k car interiors in 100k vehicles, it's ridiculous. These Chinese cars seem better and cheaper, but I'm sure we'll find a way to make them unaffordable, you know, ""to protect us"".
Ford and GM build junk vehicles. And our government regulations forces even more computerized junk in them. I miss the old reliable vehicles.
I don’t know when the last time you’ve owned one but their trucks are fantastic. 10x as powerful, better mpgs than ever, and plush interiors
Anyone who's ever owned a Chinesium battery for longer than 2 years knows not to worry about Chinese electric cars.
People dont even know. Youd figure with all the exploding chinese e-scooters that they wouldnt fuck with their cars
Ironically, many are sold into China. They’re even regarded as premium.
Nobody in China considers anything but European cars to be premium.
China is only limited by the number of Ships that can transport cars overseas, and they have like a dozen or so coming online in the next year or so. BYD exports about to explode.
You're putting alot of faith in China to not collapse into a civil war in the next 10 years.

And I have no interest in having a truck
Yep. I'll never touch a GM or Ford car.
Actually I was a tech at ford and Chevy. In my opinion from stuff I’ve seen. Ford 6.7 power stoke after the first gen 6.7 is pretty decent. And old idi 7.3 power stokes are bullet proof with regular maintenance. And for GM best motors are the lq4 lq9 mated to the 4l80e I’ve seen a couple customers with regular maintenance have clocked 500k-900k miles on regular maintenance which is insane for a gasser. I started my own diagnostics and automotive repair company, I worked as a machinist for most of my life. I can take tons of junk yard parts throw it into those vortec LS based architecture motors do it right and it’ll run forever. 4l60e transmission sucks really bad gm doesn’t make good transmissions anymore
Yeah dude, I own a Luxury Black Car Company/Limo company. When I first started you would see Lincoln Town Cars with 500k miles on them and similar with GM vehicles. Now my new Suburbans hit 170k and I have to drop a new transmission in it.
You know my conspiracy which is more than true. Most of these automotive companies and manufacturers. Make these parts and cars to fail so they profit off their $2 part they sold to us and repair places for $40 then $300 labor install. What year suburban? Compared to the Escalade and navigator I checked out I’m looking into the navigator. I honestly feels like a rolls or ultra luxury vehicle and I remember the warranty they have standard without option fees is pretty good. Your suburban has the magnaride? Have to replace those too often
Everything went down hill with the fuel economy restrictions. Turbos, small displacement, insane computer controls, 10 speed transmissions, sensors on everything. All of these are a product of economy.
Do you have EVs in your fleet? How many miles/years do they take before requiring a battery change?
Broncos awesome

Did you have off-road tires on it… because all rugged tires are loud… It’s absolutely not a hunk of shit
GM is on a whole other level. Every single one of their passenger cars is dogshit trash.
Literally all of their smaller cars are shitbox Daewoos. They looked at the 'success' of the Chevy Aveo and said 'yup, let's just cut and paste that.'
Truly, all cars are shit these days. But you still have to be a real dumb motherfucker to not just buy Japanese. Any other choice means a) you bought it for the badge, sell it before it is out of warranty or b) there really is no B, if you buy Korean or American you're a god damned fool.

And for GM best motors are the lq4 lq9 mated to the 4l80e I’ve seen a couple customers with regular maintenance have clocked 500k-900k miles on regular maintenance which is insane for a gasser. I started my own diagnostics and automotive repair company, I worked as a machinist for most of my life. I can take tons of junk yard parts throw it into those vortec LS based architecture motors do it right and it’ll run forever. 4l60e transmission sucks really bad gm doesn’t make good transmissions anymore
Yeah dude, I own a Luxury Black Car Company/Limo company. When I first started you would see Lincoln Town Cars with 500k miles on them and similar with GM vehicles. Now my new Suburbans hit 170k and I have to drop a new transmission in it.
You know my conspiracy which is more than true. Most of these automotive companies and manufacturers. Make these parts and cars to fail so they profit off their $2 part they sold to us and repair places for $40 then $300 labor install. What year suburban? Compared to the Escalade and navigator I checked out I’m looking into the navigator. I honestly feels like a rolls or ultra luxury vehicle and I remember the warranty they have standard without option fees is pretty good. Your suburban has the magnaride? Have to replace those too often
Everything went down hill with the fuel economy restrictions. Turbos, small displacement, insane computer controls, 10 speed transmissions, sensors on everything. All of these are a product of economy.
Do you have EVs in your fleet? How many miles/years do they take before requiring a battery change?
Broncos awesome

Did you have off-road tires on it… because all rugged tires are loud… It’s absolutely not a hunk of shit
GM is on a whole other level. Every single one of their passenger cars is dogshit trash.
Literally all of their smaller cars are shitbox Daewoos. They looked at the 'success' of the Chevy Aveo and said 'yup, let's just cut and paste that.'
Truly, all cars are shit these days. But you still have to be a real dumb motherfucker to not just buy Japanese. Any other choice means a) you bought it for the badge, sell it before it is out of warranty or b) there really is no B, if you buy Korean or American you're a god damned fool.

I don't imagine harder drugs would be any different, I'd expect legalization to have even less of an impact on the market than weed did honestly. I can't imagine the average heroin addict walking down to the heroin store and picking up some heroin.
I’d like to see any proof of this honestly. Been to multiple legal states. Have purchased in multiple legal states. It’s always been cheaper AND much higher quality. This seems like a really backwards misinformed comment to me
Then you don’t know heroin addicts, they would absolutely love anything that made getting drugs easier. Plus fentanyl and heroin are not even the same high, any opiate addict that knows shit about fuck would rather have heroin.

Apparently he died of an overdose a little while later. Really sad story.
https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/jerry-martin-overdose-death-1.6896186
No, actually he died from his very own “safe” drug supply that he was selling to the general public was laced with fentanyl. Google it, it’s wildly ironic.
People were in the comments explaining why, despite this, he should have been allowed to sell “safe” drugs because civil rights or something.
Sad I had to scroll so far to see this. It was a really interesting thing he did. Ensured everything he sold was lab tested and verified to be what it said on the package which is a huge deal. It’s a shame to see people dismiss this as crazy when the guy risked a lot to make a pretty bold statement on how we should be treating drug addiction.
Don’t you think it’s weird he died from his own “safe” drug supply, which he was selling to the general public, was laced with fentanyl? Respectfully, it’s almost like he was a perfect example of why his ideology is fundamentally flawed. I hope at the very least, the world is able to learn from this avoidable tragedy.
He wants the drug trade regulated and managed, like they do in Portugal
The drug trade isn't regulated in Portugal, selling drugs (including weed) is completely illegal. The only thing Portugal has done is decriminalise drug consumption.
Correct! And how do they manage addicts? I'll give you a hint: it has something to do with managed and regulated supplies of drugs at rehab sites.",2024-02-18T23:55:40.387Z,Thatguyj5,243.4

"[Streaming] The Wall Street Journal: ""Paramount+ Considering Streaming Partnership With Peacock"" | Future Star Trek projects might be in danger of getting cancelled (TrekMovie)","TREKMOVIE: ""The Wall Street Journal is reporting that Paramount Global and Comcast are exploring “joining forces in streaming through a partnership or joint venture, among several potential strategic options.” Like Paramount+, Comcast’s Peacock streaming service has struggled to compete in the streaming wars, with neither service turning a profit. Both services hover around around 1% of the total TV viewing market share, compared to around 8% for market leader Netflix.
Paramount has already formed a number of strategic partnerships for Paramount+, including Walmart, the world’s largest retailer. Last year it was reported they were in talks on bundling Paramount+ with Apple+. However, it sounds like the deal with Comcast could be more than just a marketing bundle, potentially combining Paramount+ and Peacock into a single streaming service. According the the WSJ report. “bringing the two streaming apps under one roof could produce significant cost savings—from spending on programming to marketing—and create a more in-depth offering for consumers, especially with regard to live sports.”

Too oily!
As someone who works in a professional kitchen, too oily can be fixed. Just add more ingredients to absorb some of those fats and oils. However, you can't use ingredients that are too ROTTEN. So make sure your billionaire is nice and fresh before cooking. Otherwise, just chop 'em up and add them to the combost pile.",2024-02-18T16:54:09.787Z,mj281,245.4

,"The funny part is that the author was fired just before that went to print.
Edit: I misread the dates. This article was published in February of last year and he was fired in February of this year.
I think he got fired this year while the article came out a year ago.
You're right. I misread the year.
