1,"Five Wall Street ‚ÄòCasino‚Äô Banks Hold $223 Trillion in Derivatives ‚Äî 83 Percent of All of the Derivatives held at 4,600 Banks. The vast majority of which are held in SWAPS. Everything is fine üî•","By Pam Martens and Russ Martens: February 13, 2024 ~
According to the Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission (FCIC), derivatives played a major role in the financial crash of 2007 to 2010 in the United States, the worst financial crisis in the U.S. since the Great Depression of the 1930s. The FCIC wrote in its final report: ‚Äú‚Ä¶the existence of millions of derivatives contracts of all types between systemically important financial institutions ‚Äî unseen and unknown in this unregulated market ‚Äî added to uncertainty and escalated panic‚Ä¶.‚Äù
Americans believed that the Dodd-Frank financial reform legislation of 2010 would fulfill its promise of reining in concentrated risks like derivatives. It did not. (See our report from 2015: President Has His Facts Seriously Wrong on Financial Reform.)
According to data from the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), the regulator of national banks, as of March 31, 2009, five bank holding companies held $277.57 trillion in derivatives (notional/face amount). At that time, according to the FDIC, there were 8,249 federally-insured commercial banks and savings associations in the U.S. but just five bank holding companies held 95 percent of all derivatives at all U.S. banks. Those financial institutions were: JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America, Goldman Sachs Group, Morgan Stanley and Citigroup.

33,,"An FBI agent told me once (after a bank robbery in West Seattle) that the dirty little secret about bank robberies is that a lot of robbers get away with it. At least initially. He said that the kind of desperation that leads people to rob banks is usually related to some kind of serious addiction. So based on how much money is stolen in a particular heist, they can usually crunch the numbers on the addict's burn rate and predict when that robber will strike again. And many are caught on subsequent robberies. In the West Seattle robbery, even though the police responded quickly and in force, the bank robbers made a clean escape. But fortunately, they were stupid enough to use a get-away car that had distinctive markings on it and they were subsequently nabbed a few months later, robbing another bank.
And in this robbery the perp handed the bank teller a note. So probably not a violent thug.
If these statisticians can crunch numbers on that limited a pool of variables then they are doing some kind of black magic. Working off 'industry standards' might give a baseline but there are an insane amount of individual variables that would go into that calculation, drug of choice, severity of habit, does the person swap locations. I've spent a long time in the statistics and accounting field. And this just sounds like false FBI bravado rather than magic math. More likely the robber gets cocky and fucks up, rather than they can throw chicken bones and determine when they will rob again.",2024-02-13T02:22:57.789Z,cjboffoli,11.2

100,Using Eminent Domaine To Seize Housing from Wall Street Companies,"One of the biggest problems in the U.S. are the exorbitant prices of housing and rent. We must lower prices. The following idea sounds draconian but extreme measures are needed. Hear me out: One way to force housing onto the market is for Congress to confiscate all housing, using eminent domaine laws, from Wall Street investment companies.
Though not complete, lets look at one investment firm. Blackstone owns and manages over 300,000 units of rental housing in the U.S., making it the largest landlord in the U.S. To give readers a sense of the magnitude of money involved, recently, Blackstone bought out Tricon Residential, which owned 37,478 homes, for $3.5-billion. Then there's American Homes 4 Rent, which owns 59,092 single-family homes. Invitation Homes owns 84,697 single-family homes. Most single-family rental giants are privately held or consolidated into a broader real estate investment trust (REIT). The list of Wall Street money in housing goes and on and on, and people wonder why housing is so expensive.
According to the Census Bureau, there were approximately 15.1 million vacant homes nationwide in 2022. These vacant homes, which include rentals, represent 10.5% of the country‚Äôs total housing inventory. In addition, according to national data provider CoreLogic, investment companies accounted for 27% of all single-family home purchases. This must be outlawed.

101,,"Since the Great Recession of 2008 the US has under produced housing by about 6 million units. If you add up all the homes you are wanting to confiscate, do you even get up to 5% of that underproduction? If you are going to confiscate single family homes why not duplexes or quad homes? Why not confiscate apartment buildings or condos? It makes no sense.
The answer is to build more homes of all types. If you want to pass some kind of law like no n resident aliens can't buy property go ahead. But that's not going to help some young family in St Louis get into a home.",2024-02-12T15:11:39.684Z,jammu2,26.1
102,,"This doesn't force housing on the market. Blackstone is already renting these out. It creates no more housing for people to live in. What will lower housing costs is building more housing and you can do that by getting government to get rid of a lot of the idiotic regulations that prevent housing from being built.

105,,"You have it backwards. Housing isn‚Äôt expensive and scarce because Blackstone owns it. Rather, Blackstone got into single family rentals because they know our housing policies have resulted in a massive shortage and they saw an investment opportunity.
Our housing problem is mostly caused by zoning and other regulations that make it slow and expensive to add new supply in many areas. Until that changes it doesn‚Äôt matter who owns or builds houses, they won‚Äôt be affordable. Established homeowners have no incentive to change this, the status quo has made housing a good investment and residents like neighborhoods that never change. Now that private equity and REITs are taking advantage of the situation more people are noticing, but it‚Äôs a symptom not the disease.
What you are describing as eminent domain wouldn‚Äôt add any new housing supply or address the underlying economic factors. It sounds more like state appropriation of housing. The US has a terrible record with public housing, it ends up being poorly managed and expensive to produce. I know of an affordable housing project in my city that cost nearly $1 million per unit to build.
A version of this idea that could work is states taking or threatening to take land via eminent domain, applying better zoning, and removing regulatory barriers so inexpensive housing can be produced by home builders quickly. We need an elastic supply.
I personally think it‚Äôs good to have a healthy number of rental homes. Not so many as to distort the market, but we are no where near that number. My girlfriend‚Äôs family moved sixteen times in eighteen years and they bought and sold pretty much all of the houses they lived in. I think they would have loved good rental options.

.@Bloomberg's @reporterev reports that banks are pushing back against @FDICgov's proposal to strengthen corporate governance & risk management of banks and their leadership. However, studies show that bank boards all failed miserably in 2008 and in the 2023 banking crisis.
In our comment letter, we supported @FDICgov's proposal, noting that firms should be held accountable for appropriate corporate governance and risk management to protect all stakeholders and the financial system. news.bloomberglaw.com/banking-law/ba‚Ä¶
FDIC‚ÄôS PROPOSAL TO IMPROVE BANKS‚Äô GOVERNANCE AND RISK MANAGEMENT WILL HELP PREVENT FAILURES AND CRASHES THAT DEVASTATE MAIN STREET
WASHINGTON, D.C.‚Äî Dennis M. Kelleher, Co-Founder, President, and CEO, issued the following statement on the filing of Better Markets‚Äô Comment Letter to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), urging them to adopt improved and enforceable guidelines for corporate governance and risk management structures for the largest banks.
‚ÄúUnlike most other corporations, the consequences of large banks being poorly run can be catastrophic to innocent hardworking Americans. To avoid that, bank boards of directors are charged with ensuring that banks have robust risk management and internal control frameworks, and effectively overseeing senior management. Unfortunately, those bank boards all failed miserably in 2008, as did the bank boards involved in the 2023 banking crisis, and that contributed significantly to the banking crises, which both times lead to contagion and bailouts. These crises once again demonstrated how inadequate corporate governance is and how much it needs to be strengthened.
‚ÄúThe FDIC‚Äôs proposal represents a crucial step towards better protecting the financial system from banking collapses and their fallout by raising the standards and expectations for board and management structures at large banks to align with the dangers they pose to the American people. Mismanagement, recklessness, negligence, and ignorance can no longer be tolerated. The proposal has several strengths, including greater detail on expectations for both the board and management, as well as the enforceability of these requirements. We also applaud the FDIC‚Äôs support of the need for board diversity but encourage more focus on the need for greater banking expertise. Board members must have sufficient knowledge and skills to effectively fulfill their fiduciary duties at large and complex banks.
‚ÄúImportantly, this proposal is tailored and targeted at the greatest risks that can cause the greatest damage, which is why it applies to only 57 of the 3,012 banks that the FDIC supervises. The FDIC should promptly approve and implement these long overdue and much needed requirements.‚Äù",2024-02-14T18:52:13.869Z,awwshitGents,33.2

Senator Sherrod Brown to Secretary of the Treasury Janet Yellen: FSOC Must Be There to Protect Our Economy When Wall Street Tries to Duck Regulators.
""FSOC makes Wall Street nervous‚Äînervous that FSOC could bring oversight and accountability to parts of Wall Street that wouldn‚Äôt otherwise get it.""
""When Wall Street tries to shapeshift to evade the watchdogs we depend on, FSOC must be there to take action to protect our economy.""
Yesterday, the SEC adopted amendments to enhance private fund reporting including those also registered with the CFTC.
The amendments to Form PF will enhance reporting by large hedge fund advisers on various aspects such as investment exposures, borrowing, counterparty exposure, risk metrics, and investment performance to improve insight into fund operations and strategies, and enhance data quality and comparability.
Additional information will be required about advisers and the private funds they manage, including details on assets under management, withdrawal rights, gross and net asset values, inflows and outflows, and fund performance, aimed at providing a deeper understanding of private funds‚Äô operations, assisting in trend identification, and reducing reporting errors.
The changes will also demand more detailed reporting on investment strategies, counterparty exposures, and trading and clearing mechanisms, while eliminating redundant questions to offer a clearer view of hedge funds‚Äô operations and strategies, help in trend analysis, and enhance data quality and comparability.
Goes into affect 1 year after being published in the Federal Register.
What others are saying:
SEC Chair Gary Gensler: ""I am pleased to support the adoption because it will improve the quality of the information we receive, particularly from large hedge fund advisers. This will help the SEC & FSOC to better assess systemic risk and protect investors.""
Commissioner Hester M. Peirce: ""I write to dissent from the latest unwarranted expansion of Form PF. These revisions stem from the Commission‚Äôs unbridled curiosity rather than from a legitimate regulatory objective.""
Commissioner Mark T. Uyeda: ""Apparently, every burden the Commission can possibly conjure is necessary and appropriate in the public interest and for the protection of investors, or for the assessment of systemic risk by FSOC.""",2024-02-09T14:31:18.823Z,Superstonk_QV,44.1

279,,"I understand the need on the employer side, but it's their problem, not the employee one. For me it's simple, non-compete agreement should be allowed, but if the employee signed it, then the company should give him the same salary during his non-compete agreement period, and this with no regard if the employee resigns or get fired.
Something like that. We could imagine for example some usecases:
- if the employee leave during the probation period, he is free of non compete agreement
- if the employee is under 1/3y in the company, the non compete agreement isn't applied if he resigns or he is fired
- if the employer fire someone, then the employer have the choice to either take the charge during the employee non-compete period or to free him of it effective at the resignation date.
I never understand why the employee had to be the one being penalized for the non-compete agreement. It's not our business or if it is, then give us money.
I don‚Äôt think your argument is a bad one, but you could simply counter with a job requiring a noncompete agreement pays more than one without. If you as an employee aren‚Äôt making more due to a noncompete clause with an employer then you should negotiate for that. If your employer won‚Äôt negotiate then you have to make the decision to look for another job or if you don‚Äôt care about the noncompete.
That being said, noncompete clauses should require a substantial need by the company to be enforceable, and require strict statutory limits.",2024-02-10T09:50:08.844Z,ElWorkplaceDestroyer,55.1

We are yet to see any substantial FII inflow in the market this year.
We hear news about Indian weight increasing in MSCI but where are the flow?
1)When do you expect them to come?
2)Which areas do you think will be the target?
3)Do you think these flow will only be focused on large caps? Or will small and mid caps see some lift?
Hi, Srinivasan this side. Here's answering part 2 of your question
Wall Street is betting on the overall growth story in India. The opportunities in the country, in their view, are varied all the way from large caps to small caps and in multiple industries. But if you have to zero in on a few as examples: Businesses riding on consumer demand such as retail and housing. Businesses riding on India Digital Stack such as payments companies. New businesses listing such as Bangalore unicorns. But we are talking about hundreds of billions of dollars flowing over several years. At different times, the outperforming industries will vary and so will investor preferences.
Hi, thanks for your questions, Ishika here answering part 1 of your question.
2023 was a strong year for foreign inflows into the Indian equity market. It got more than $21 billion in net flows, beating any other emerging Asian market outside China.
With Indian benchmarks running close to record highs and room for other markets such as Taiwan and South Korea to rally, India's falling behind this year. There's also some trepidation about getting into the market ahead of the national polls.

After weeks of speculation, Zelensky dismissed Gen. Valeriy Zaluzhniy as commander in chief of the armed forces in the most significant shake-up of the country‚Äôs leadership in nearly two years of war.
The move is aimed at rebooting the country‚Äôs war effort, Zelensky said, as Ukrainian forces struggle to hold the line against Russia. But replacing a figure as popular as Zaluzhniy with Col. Gen. Oleksandr Syrskiy, who is seen as closer to the president, will bind Zelensky more tightly to battlefield decisions, making him more accountable for any failure, analysts said.
